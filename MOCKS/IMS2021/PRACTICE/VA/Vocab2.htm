'Remain' is a verb, and is therefore\r\n  grammatically incorrect, as only a noun\/noun phrase can follow an article. So\r\n  only 'remains', which means traces, fits.

The next sentence talks about negotiating the Ganges. The correct word to fill this blank would be \u2018sludge\u2019 which means \u2018a deposit of ooze at the bottom of a body of water\u2019. The last blank talks about playing in the waters of the Arabian Sea. So, \u2018sloshing\u2019, which means \u2018splashing or moving through water, mud or slush\u2019, correctly fits the blank.

In the second sentence the word \u2018dissolute\u2019 means indifferent to moral restraints and \u2018desolate\u2019 means devastated, barren or laid waste. The word that would go with waywardness would be dissolute. The word \u2018facetious\u2019 means not meant to be taken seriously and \u2018factitious\u2019 means not spontaneous or natural, so the word that fits best is facetious. \u2018Ingenuousness\u2019 means free from reserve or restraint and \u2018ingeniousness\u2019 means cleverly inventive or resourceful.
