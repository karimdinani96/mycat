During the vacation, he visited the local casino where he came across a new card game. Two players, using a normal deck of 52 playing cards, play this game. One player is called the Dealer and the other is called the Player. First the player picks a card at random from the deck. This is called the base card. The amount in rupees equal to the face value of the base card is called the base amount. The face values of Ace, King, Queen, and Jack are ten. For other cards, the face value is the number on the card. Once, the player picks a card from the deck, the dealer pays him the base amount. Then the dealer picks a card from the deck and this card is called the top card. If the top card is of the same suit as the base card, the player pays twice the base amount to the dealer. If the top card is of the same suit as the base card, the player pays twice the base amount to the dealer. If the top card is of the same colour as the base card (but not the same suit) then the player pays the base amount to the dealer. If the top card happens to be of a different colour than the base card, the dealer pays the base amount to the player.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Ghosh Babu played the game 4 times. First time he picked eight of clubs and the dealer picked queen of clubs. Second time, he picked ten of hearts and the dealer picked two of spades. Next time, Ghosh Babu picked six of diamonds and the dealer picked ace of hearts. Lastly, he picked eight of spades and the dealer picked jack of spades.
