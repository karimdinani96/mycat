Obviously, the two are mutually opposed; in other societies the contradiction would have asphyxiated the institution. In India the older tradition co-opted the younger institution. People flocked to polling booths but voted mostly according to caste affiliations. Numerical majorities prevailed, but candidates continued to represent segments of the established hierarchic structure. In the 1990s, the largely agrarian intermediate castes- sought to convert their steadily growing economic clout into political power. Their leaders asked for &mdash; and got &mdash; reservations in government jobs in the name of the downtrodden. But the OBCs remained inimical to those lower down the traditional social hierarchy, the Dalits and minority tribes, earlier beneficiaries of affirmative action as part of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.<\/p><p>Irrespective of their social background, the elected are acutely conscious of their status. The privileges and immunities that proclaim their superior status have grown, not lessened, in democratic India. The process unconsciously mimics the special privileges accorded to the higher castes. The democratic idea has blended too with the felt need to project power. Elected representatives show no reticence in flaunting their visible symbols of authority.<\/p><p>In the years just after 1947 there was a conscious attempt, probably under the short-lived influence of Gandhi, to curb the proclivities of the earlier tradition. It was a losing battle. The mentalities of the past very soon got the upper hand over the fledgling new values enshrined in the democratic experiment. In fact, over the years, as the very functioning of the democratic process enhanced the &lsquo;legitimacy&rsquo; of those who emerged victorious, their behaviour has acquired a blatancy that openly mocks notions of democratic restraint or rectitude.<\/p><p>When parliamentary democracy was introduced, most Indian politicians were attracted by the rewards of the democratic process, not by the democratic idea. Under the warrant of precedence, an elected member of even a provincial legislature was ranked higher than the highest bureaucrat of the State. More importantly, at the local level, an elected representative was suddenly catapulted above the district administrative chief and the superintendent of police who, following the practice of the colonial regime, were earlier all powerful and quite unapproachable. Success in democratic politics therefore ensured rapid upward mobility, and the possibility of this sudden accretion of power sent a surge of anticipation through the stagnant waters of Indian society.<\/p><p>It is no surprise then that the phenomenal growth in the infrastructure of democracy &mdash; the size of the electorate, the number of polling booths, the thousands of counting machines, the length of ballot papers, the reach of the Election Commission &mdash; has happily coexisted with undemocratic trends in political behaviour. Political parties are rarely democratic internally. The word of the leader is law. Political dynasties proliferate, regardless of merit. Dissent is neither encouraged nor tolerated. Sycophancy abounds, and has conventional sanction. A leading magazine recently did a survey on which leader Indians trust the most. The not unsurprising choice was Indira Gandhi, the lady who suspended democracy to impose the Emergency in 1975. Her imperious style, and the unemotional way she dealt with her political opponents and those who fell from her favour, answered a subconscious predisposition in the Indian psyche to look up to and accept a &lsquo;strong&rsquo; leader. The leading psychoanalyst Sudhir Kakar ascribes this to &ldquo;an unconscious tendency to &lsquo;submit&rsquo; to an idealised omnipotent figure, both in the inner world of fantasy and in the outside world of making a living; the lifelong search for someone, a charismatic leader or a guru, who will provide mentorship and a guiding world-view, thereby restoring intimacy and authority to individual life.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Indira Gandhi continues to be widely respected for the dexterity and confidence with which she played the power game, and the ruthlessness with which she moved to achieve her political goals. A concern for democracy was, in any case, conspicuously absent in most educated Indians when she imposed the Emergency. There was not even a semblance of credible protest anywhere in the country when almost the entire opposition was put in jail. The bureaucracy quietly accepted the new regimen. The corporate world welcomed it. The most spectacular capitulation was among the so-called guardians of the right of free dissent and free expression &mdash; the media. They crawled when they had only been asked to bend, with many top editors assuming the &lsquo;traditional Indian posture of respectful subservience (in which) they remained &mdash; not looking particularly dignified until the Emergency was over&rsquo;. A dominant image of that time was a much publicised triptych in oils of Mrs. Gandhi by the colourful artist M.F. Husain, representing her as the goddess Durga triumphantly vanquishing her foes. The poor bore the brunt of the excesses of the Emergency, and ultimately, when elections were called, it was their hostility that defeated Indira.

These inconsistencies\u00a0were reflected by its spokesmen who took conflicting stances in many areas; but\u00a0on the subject of race, the conflicts were particularly vivid. The idea that the Caucasian\u00a0race and the European civilisation were superior was well ingrained in the culture\u00a0of the colonists at the very time that the \u201cegalitarian\u201d republic was founded. Voluminous\u00a0historical evidence suggests that, the average colonist thought the African as a heathen,\u00a0he was black, and he was different in crucial philosophical ways. As time progressed,\u00a0he was also increasingly taken captive, adding to the conception of deviance. The\u00a0African, therefore, could be justifiably, even philanthropically treated as property according\u00a0to the reasoning of slave traders and slaveholders.\u00a0<\/p><p>Although slaves were treated as objects, abundant evidence suggests that they themselves\u00a0didn\u2019t subscribe to this view. There are many published autobiographies of slaves; African-\u00a0American scholars are beginning to know enough about West African culture, to appreciate\u00a0the existential climate in which the early captives were raised and which thus could\u00a0not be totally destroyed by the enslavement experience. The climate was one that defined\u00a0the individual in collective terms. Individuals were members of a tribe, within which they\u00a0had predetermined roles to play depending on the history of their family within the tribe.\u00a0Individuals were intrinsically a part of the natural elements on which they depended, and they\u00a0were actively related to those tribal members who once lived and to those not yet\u00a0born.<\/p><p>The colonial plantation system that was established and forced upon the Africans virtually eliminated tribal affiliations. Individuals were separated from kin; interrelationships among kin kept together were often transient because of sales. A new identification with the slaves working and living together in a given place would satisfy what was undoubtedly a natural tendency to be a member of a group. New family units became the most important attachments of individual slaves. Thus, as the system of slavery was gradually institutionalised, West African affiliation tendencies adapted\u00a0to it.<\/p><p>This highly complex dual influence is still reflected in black community life, and the double consciousness of black Americans is the major characteristic of African-American mentality. Dubois articulated this divided consciousness as follows: The history of the American Negro is the history of this strife \u2013 this yearning to attain self-conscious manhood, to merge his double-self into a better and truer self.

Education must then play a very important part in a writer&rsquo;s&nbsp;work.<\/p><p>That seems so obvious that it is astonishing how little stress has been laid upon the&nbsp;writer&rsquo;s education. Perhaps it is because a writer&rsquo;s education is so much less definite&nbsp;than other educations. Reading, listening, talking, travel, leisure &ndash; many different things&nbsp;it seems are mixed together. Life and books must be shaken and taken in the right&nbsp;proportions. A boy brought up alone in a library turns into a bookworm; brought up alone&nbsp;in the fields, he turns into an earthworm. To breed the kind of butterfly a writer is, you&nbsp;must let him sun himself for three or four years at Oxford or Cambridge &ndash; so it seems.&nbsp;However it is done, it is there it is done &ndash; there that he is taught his art. And he has&nbsp;to be taught his art. Again, is that strange? Nobody thinks it strange if you say that&nbsp;a painter has to be taught his art; or a musician; or an architect. Equally a writer has&nbsp;to be taught. For the art of writing is at least as difficult as the other arts. And though,&nbsp;perhaps because the education is indefinite, people ignore this education, if you look&nbsp;closely you will see that almost every writer who has practised his art successfully had&nbsp;been taught it. He had been taught it by about eleven years of education &ndash; at private&nbsp;schools, public schools, and universities. He sits upon a tower raised above the rest&nbsp;of us; a tower built first on his parents&rsquo; station, then on his parents&rsquo; gold. It is a tower&nbsp;of the utmost importance; it decides his angle of vision; it affects his power of communication.&nbsp;All through the nineteenth century, down to August 1914, that tower was a steady tower.&nbsp;The writer was scarcely conscious either of his high station or of his limited vision.&nbsp;Many of them had sympathy, great sympathy, with other classes; they wished to help&nbsp;the working class to enjoy the advantages of the tower class; but they did not wish&nbsp;to destroy the tower, or to descend from it &ndash; rather to make it accessible to all. Nor&nbsp;had the model, human life, changed essentially since Trollope looked at it, since Hardy&nbsp;looked at it and Henry James, in 1914, was still looking at it. Also, the tower itself held&nbsp;firm beneath the writer during all the most impressionable years, when he was learning&nbsp;his art, and receiving all those complex influences and instructions that are summed&nbsp;up by the word education.

And that too on an issue relating to women? Yes! According to the proposed Companies (Amendment) Bill 2003, any public company with paid up capital and free reserves of Rs. 5 crore or more will be required to have a certain number of women directors on board. The exact number has not been prescribed; perhaps that&rsquo;s because our lawmakers are no more serious about this than they are about the bill reserving seats in Parliament for women.

Indeed, we would have gone one step further. Currently, the appointment of women directors is not a legal requirement in either of these two countries.

From a scenario where women directors are almost an oddity (except where they come from promoter families), female directors will become the rule rather than the exception once the amendment is passed.

Partly because we genuinely don&rsquo;t have enough CEO-level women who could be appointed directors. And partly because ingenious ways will be found to circumvent the law thanks to a combination of poor law enforcement and absence of share-holder activism. Consequently, even if the proposed amendment is passed, in all probability we will simply see a host of corporate Rabri Devis joining company boards.<\/p><p>In any case, the moment women&rsquo;s reservation is treated as a matter of dogma; it loses its raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre. Which is why all right thinking people, including women&rsquo;s organisations, need to see the proposed amendment in the Companies Act for what it is &mdash; a ploy to placate women and distract them from their main demand for space on the political platform.<\/p><p>Quite possibly we have taken the Scandinavian countries as our role model. But given the huge gap between the position of women in India and these countries, it&rsquo;s like comparing chalk and cheese.<\/p><p>The case for women&rsquo;s reservation, moreover, rests on two premises. One, that women are disadvantaged by the mere fact of their gender and two, that women bring in a critical extra dimension, a variety, a richness of perspective that would be lost without them. Viewed against this yardstick, reserving seats for women on company boards cannot be compared with reservation in Parliament. Because even if the first premise is fulfilled &mdash; male bonding is as much a fact of life in corporate as in political circles &mdash; there is a crucial difference when we look at the second premise.<\/p><p>The duty of an MP is to his\/her constituency. It is an acknowledged fact that the interests and priorities of men and women differ a great deal, especially when it comes to matters relating to health, children&rsquo;s education, prohibition, smoking and so on. There is, therefore, a sound case for more women in Parliament as women are more likely than men to keep these interests in mind while framing government policies. In contrast, the duty of a director on the board of a company is to the shareholders of the company. And here it is facile to argue that the interests of shareholders are in any way conditioned by their gender. They are not. As shareholders, they are only interested in maximising profits. If one takes a larger perspective of &lsquo;stakeholders&rsquo; rather than shareholders, then women directors may prove more gender-sensitive; but one cannot generalise. The choice of a director on the board of a company must therefore be decided on merit and competence alone.

Though his date is uncertain, quite definitely his is the earliest grammatical treatise extant on any Indo-European language, and the earliest scientific work in any Indo-European language, and in Bloomfield&rsquo;s words &lsquo;one of the greatest monuments of human intelligence&rsquo;. However, while it brings almost to perfection its avowed intentions in the field of Sanskrit grammar with which it deals, it is not what would ordinarily be called a complete grammar of the Sanskrit language. It would, perhaps, best be described in modern terms as a generative morphology of Sanskrit.<\/p><p>Panini&rsquo;s grammar includes as its main component an exhaustive statement of the rules of word formation of Sanskrit. These rules are expressed in short statements, or aphorisms as they are often called, giving either definitions, or processes of word formation. Each is referred to as a sutra, thread, a term also used of the ritual instructions in some of the earlier Vedic literature. There are also appendices giving a list of verbal roots, a list of similarly inflected nominal words, and a list of the sounds of Sanskrit. The rules, like the rules of today&rsquo;s generative grammarians, have to be applied in set order; and apart from the completeness with which Panini covers every aspect of Sanskrit word formation, those who have studied his work, whether in India or later in Europe, have been most struck by the ingenuity with which he achieved the extreme economy of his statements. This quest for economy was evidently part of the context of early Indian grammatical composition; a commentator remarked that the saving of half the length of a short vowel in framing a grammatical rule meant as much to a grammarian as the birth of a son. This demand for economy may have been inspired primarily by the needs of oral recitation and commitment to memory, but it clearly became a canon of scholarly merit in its own right.

Although it is partially derived from the proposition that the capacity of the stomach is limited, it should be noted that it is expenditure, not amount of food eaten, that Engel&rsquo;s law applies to. Calories consumed level off well before expenditure. The law does not apply to very poor families, whose expenditure rises proportionately or even more than proportionately, as their incomes increase. It is between 80 and 85 per cent of their total outlay. The poverty line has at times been defined as that level of income at which the proportion of expenditure on food begins to decline. It is among members of the groups below this poverty line that the risk of nutritional damage is the greatest.<\/p><p>Bennett&rsquo;s law states that the ratio of starchy staple food consumed declines as incomes rise. Starchy staples, comprising mainly grain and root crops, are the cheapest form of food. As incomes rise, families diversify their consumption into dearer calories. The quality of food, measured by prices paid for it, rises with income. When income is calculated for the purpose of testing these laws, addictive expenditures (e.g. on cigarettes) and interest on loans may have to be deducted before determining available income, for they do not represent discretionary components of income.

But there were some that turned from evil and left the lands of their kindred, and wandered ever westward; for they had heard a rumour that in the West there was a light which the Shadow could not dim. The servants of Morgoth pursued them with hatred, and their ways were long and hard; yet they came at last to the lands that look upon the Sea, and they entered Beleriand in the days of the War of the Jewels. The Edain, these were named in the Sindarin tongue; and they became friends and allies of the Eldar, and did deeds of great valour in the war against Morgoth.&nbsp;<br \/><br \/>Of them was sprung, upon the side of his fathers, Bright E&auml;rendil; and in the Lay of E&auml;rendil it is told how at the last, when the victory of Morgoth was almost complete, he built his ship Vingilot and voyaged upon the unsailed seas, seeking ever for Valinor; for he desired to speak before the Powers on behalf of the Two Kindreds, that the Valar might have pity on them and send them help in their uttermost need. He achieved his quest after long labours and many perils, and from Valinor there came the host of the Lords of the West.&nbsp;<br \/><br \/>In the Great Battle, when at last Morgoth was overthrown and Thangorodrim was broken, the Edain alone of the kindreds of Men fought for the Valar, whereas many others fought for Morgoth. And after the victory of the Lords of the West those of the evil Men who were not destroyed fled back into the east, where many of their race were still wandering in the unharvested lands, wild and lawless, refusing alike the summons of the Valar and of Morgoth. And the evil Men came among them, and cast over them a shadow of fear, and they took them for kings. Then the Valar forsook for a time the Men of Middle-earth who had refused their summons and had taken the friends of Morgoth to be their masters; and Men dwelt in darkness and their lot was unhappy.&nbsp;<br \/><br \/>But the Valar put forth Morgoth and shut him beyond the World in the Void that is without; and he cannot himself return again into the World, present and visible, while the Lords of the West are still enthroned. Yet the seeds that he had planted still grew and sprouted, bearing evil fruit, if any would tend them. For his will remained and guided his servants, moving them ever to thwart the will of the Valar and to destroy those that obeyed them. This the Lords of the West knew full well. When therefore Morgoth had been thrust forth, they held council concerning the ages that should come after. The Eldar they summoned to return into the West, and they dwelt in the Isle of Eress&euml;a, near Valinor. To the Edain, rich reward also was given; they were given wisdom and power and life more enduring than any others of mortal race have possessed.

If unrestricted time travel were possible, even in principle, the nature of such a unified theory could be drastically affected. <br \/><br \/>Our best understanding of time comes from Einstein&rsquo;s theories of relativity. Prior to these theories, time was widely regarded as absolute and universal, the same for everyone no matter what their physical circumstances were. In his special theory of relativity, Einstein proposed that the measured interval between two events depends on how the observer is moving. Crucially, two observers who move differently will experience different durations between the same two events. <br \/><br \/>The effect is often described using the &lsquo;twin paradox&rsquo;. Suppose that Sally and Sam are twins. Sally boards a rocket ship and travels at high speed to a nearby star, turns around and flies back to Earth, while Sam stays at home. For Sally the duration of the journey might be, say, one year, but when she returns and steps out of the spaceship, she finds that 10 years have elapsed on Earth. Her brother is now nine years older than she is, despite the fact that they were born on the same day. This example illustrates a limited type of time travel. In effect, Sally has leaped nine years into the Earth&rsquo;s future. <br \/><br \/>The effect, known as time dilation, occurs whenever two observers move relative to each other. In daily life we don&rsquo;t notice weird time warps, because the effect becomes dramatic only when the motion occurs at close to the speed of light. Even at aircraft speeds, the time dilation in a typical journey amounts to just a few nanoseconds. Nevertheless, atomic clocks are accurate enough to record the shift and confirm that time really is stretched by motion. So travel into the future is a proved fact, even if it has so far been in rather unexciting amounts. <br \/><br \/>To observe really dramatic time warps, one has to look beyond the realm of ordinary experience.

In his general theory of relativity, Einstein predicted that gravity slows time. Clocks run faster in space than on the ground. At the surface of a neutron star, gravity is so strong that time is slowed by about 30 percent relative to Earth time. Viewed from such a star, events here would resemble a fast-forwarded video.

In science fiction, wormholes are sometimes called stargates; they offer a shortcut between two widely separated points in space.

If unrestricted time travel were possible, even in principle, the nature of such a unified theory could be drastically affected. <br \/><br \/>Our best understanding of time comes from Einstein&rsquo;s theories of relativity. Prior to these theories, time was widely regarded as absolute and universal, the same for everyone no matter what their physical circumstances were. In his special theory of relativity, Einstein proposed that the measured interval between two events depends on how the observer is moving. Crucially, two observers who move differently will experience different durations between the same two events. <br \/><br \/>The effect is often described using the &lsquo;twin paradox&rsquo;. Suppose that Sally and Sam are twins. Sally boards a rocket ship and travels at high speed to a nearby star, turns around and flies back to Earth, while Sam stays at home. For Sally the duration of the journey might be, say, one year, but when she returns and steps out of the spaceship, she finds that 10 years have elapsed on Earth. Her brother is now nine years older than she is, despite the fact that they were born on the same day. This example illustrates a limited type of time travel. In effect, Sally has leaped nine years into the Earth&rsquo;s future. <br \/><br \/>The effect, known as time dilation, occurs whenever two observers move relative to each other. In daily life we don&rsquo;t notice weird time warps, because the effect becomes dramatic only when the motion occurs at close to the speed of light. Even at aircraft speeds, the time dilation in a typical journey amounts to just a few nanoseconds. Nevertheless, atomic clocks are accurate enough to record the shift and confirm that time really is stretched by motion. So travel into the future is a proved fact, even if it has so far been in rather unexciting amounts. <br \/><br \/>To observe really dramatic time warps, one has to look beyond the realm of ordinary experience. Subatomic particles can be propelled at nearly the speed of light in large accelerator machines. Some of these particles inside accelerators are observed to decay in slow motion. Some cosmic rays also experience spectacular time warps. <br \/><br \/>Speed is one way to jump ahead in time. Gravity is another. In his general theory of relativity, Einstein predicted that gravity slows time. Clocks run faster in space than on the ground. At the surface of a neutron star, gravity is so strong that time is slowed by about 30 percent relative to Earth time. Viewed from such a star, events here would resemble a fast-forwarded video. A black hole represents the ultimate time warp; at the surface of the hole, time stands still relative to Earth. This means that if you fell into a black hole from nearby, in the brief interval it took you to reach the surface, all of eternity would pass by in the wider universe. <br \/><br \/>So far I have discussed travel forward in time. What about going backward? This is much more problematic. In theory, a shortcut through space could enable an astronaut to reach his own past. This is the idea behind the concept of a wormhole. In science fiction, wormholes are sometimes called stargates; they offer a shortcut between two widely separated points in space. Jump through a hypothetical wormhole, and you might come out moments later on the other side of the galaxy. Wormholes naturally fit into the general theory of relativity, whereby gravity warps not only time but also space. Just as a tunnel passing under a hill can be shorter than the surface street, a wormhole may be shorter than the usual route through ordinary space.<\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":0,"NegativePoints":0,"Explanation":"<p>The last paragraph of this passage offers very limited information on wormholes, so we can infer that if the passage were to be continued, more information about wormholes and their use as time machines would be forthcoming.

Move a bit upward and you sense the contour of the rim.<\/p><p>Then there&rsquo;s the CyberGrasp, a haptic glove that you slip on. Its makers, Virtual Technologies Inc. of Palo Alto, California, call it a &lsquo;lightweight, unencumbering, force-reflecting exoskeleton&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s anything but lightweight and un-encumbering, but that doesn&rsquo;t detract from the eerie feeling you get of being able to touch something that isn&rsquo;t there.<br \/>There are serious applications too, like virtual-reality job training, computer-aided design and remote handling of hazardous materials. Sculptors can do their thing as naturally in digital form as they do in clay or stone, and surgeons can practise their skills on virtual patients, instead of actual people. Medical students perform operations on virtual organs that have the texture, weight, and fragility of real body parts. This a lot less risky than experimenting on real patients, and a lot better than relying on simulations.<\/p><p><br \/>The Harvard School of Dental Medicine, for example, plans to build a dental-training facility that will enable students to practice on virtual molars. Haptics technology will make it possible for the students to feel every ridge and bump of a tooth that doesn&rsquo;t even exist, and to feel the pressure of a drill in their hands as they work on the tooth.<\/p><p><br \/>Though e-business has taken off, one of the drawbacks of shopping online is the absence of tactile stimulation. For instance, how can you possibly want to buy a cashmere sweater without feeling it first? Touch-before-you-buy technology could thus have a big impact on e-commerce by letting surfers touch and feel products while shopping online. It could also add reality to on-line computer gaming.<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>Some day, haptics technology may even offer a novel way to connect with people online, redefining the very concept of reaching out and touching someone. In the future, don&rsquo;t be surprised if you can feel somebody shake your hand when they call you on your mobile phone. Unfortunately, then we&rsquo;ll have to deal with the problem of online gropers too &ndash; but that&rsquo;s a different story.<\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":0,"NegativePoints":0,"Explanation":"<p>Options [1], [3] and [4] actually strengthen the argument that Haptic Technology would bolster the success of e-business.

At first, Czarina Marie Fedorovna could have been excused for being underwhelmed by Alexander's offering: it was a plain enamelled egg - the traditional Russian Easter gift. Inside the egg, though, she found a yolk made of gold; inside that, an exquisite golden hen on a bed of golden straw; inside that, a miniature diamond crown; and inside that, a tiny ruby pendant. She'd never seen anything like it. It so captivated the family that its maker, Carl Gustavovich Faberge, earned the right to display the royal seal.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Nearly every Easter thereafter, Alexander III gave a new Faberge creation to Marie; when he died, his son Czar Nicholas II continued each spring to present an egg, one to his wife, Alexandra, and one to his mother. Between 1885 and 1916, 50 'imperial eggs' were made for the czars.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Over the years the Faberge eggs grew more elaborate, each with a theme calculated to charm its recipient. When Marie's sons went to sea in 1890 on a Russian cruiser, the Azova Egg the following spring contained a gold and platinum replica of the ship floating on aquamarine, with diamonds for portholes. The Danish Palaces Egg from that period was so complex - featuring watercolour miniatures of palaces from the czarina's youth in Denmark - that it took a year to make. The 1913 Winter Egg, made - of rock crystal and designed to imitate ice, was so perfectly etched and polished that it seemed freezing to the touch. Marie called Faberge the 'greatest genius of our time'. (What did Tolstoy ever do for her?)<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Luscious though Faberge eggs might be, Toby Faber's book Faberge's Eggs is not just about glittering baubles. He argues that these objects have something to teach us about history. Noting, for instance, that Carl Faberge borrowed designs from the court jewellers of eighteenth-century French kings, Mr. Faber observes that the French and Russian dynasties, both coming to gory ends, had both also debauched themselves in riches.

Option [2] claims that Faberge's fame did not merely rest upon his eggs, but also on the other objects he created; so Forbes's purchase of the eggs could not have been the reason for said fame. Option [3] acknowledges that Forbes paid an extraordinarily large sum for the eggs, but also points out that this was not the cause for the eggs' being considered extremely valuable.

Option [1] is the best counterargument: if it is easy for extraterrestrial beings to travel much faster than human beings, then the distances we consider daunting may not be so for them, and so they could travel to earth casually even for 'small rewards'.

The humble mobile phone.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Ever since mobiles began their steady march from the periphery of technology into our back pockets, the menace of textspeak has been frightening parents, teachers and correspondents to letters pages. Stories abound of students handing in essays written in SMS lingo, of children losing the ability to spell, and of them losing the ability to discern between situations when it's appropriate to write abbreviated English and when it isn't.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>According to linguistics expert David Crystal, these fears are not justified. His new study, txting: the gr8 db8, shows the reverse might be true and presents a compelling argument in favour of texting as a force for, and signifier of, linguistic ability.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>His discoveries make for fascinating reading. You might think that text messages exchanged by young people are gobbledygook. Certainly messages such as 'prw, ttyl' ('parents watching, talk to you later') are hard for the uninitiated to understand.

Recent work in developmental psychology offers a sharply contrasted picture. Children are unconsciously the most rational beings on earth, brilliantly drawing accurate conclusions from data, performing complex statistical analyses, and doing clever experiments. Not only does empirical work reveal this about babies and small children, but also throws light on some of philosophy's more intriguing questions about knowledge, the self, other minds and the basis of morality.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Such are the claims made by philosopher and developmental psychologist Alison Gopnik in this fascinating account of the growth of child minds. Gopnik describes how imagination contributes to the vast amount of knowledge that children acquire in their first few years. Accumulated knowledge allows children to think of alternative ways that the world could be, which in turn helps them construct mental maps of the causal relationships that govern and explain how things work. Imagination also aids them in forming ideas about how other people think and act. Many children have 'imaginary friends'; their ability to understand others and to change themselves is aided by the possibilities for exploring alternatives that such play affords.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>This learning proceeds by experimentation and recognition of statistical patterns. In the child the application of these methods is unconscious and instinctive, and it is aided by the presence of caregivers who provide active instruction. But the basis of child learning is no different from the more conscious and deliberate methodology of adult enquirers.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Studies of child development also suggest insights into consciousness. Children appear to have a far more vivid awareness of the world around them than adults because an adult's 'spotlight awareness' that enables concentration on specific features of an environment involves losing the 'lantern awareness' that brings the whole environment to the forefront of attention. This childhood form of awareness is likened by Gopnik to how adults feel when they visit a foreign country; they focus less on particulars and experience everything more globally because of unfamiliarity. But if children have a more intense lantern awareness, they also have less inner consciousness of the kind that helps manufacture a distinctive sense of self, that autobiographical centre of memory and planning which is the 'me' in all experience. That explains why they have less command of their behaviour, and less sense of the future.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Gopnik's affectionate and sympathetic enjoyment of the way children think in their first five years is manifest throughout her book, but so too is her sensitivity to the deeper philosophical implications of what their way of thinking can teach us. The result is absorbing and educative, despite the fact that, at times, it seems as if developmental psychology provides scientific confirmation for what parents and preschool teachers have long known. But Gopnik is skilled at producing the rabbit of insight from an apparently old hat. And there is much that is new and surprising in the field, promising to change our understanding of mind in general.<\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":0,"NegativePoints":0,"Explanation":"<p>It should be quite clear that the passage is an extract from a book review.

Gopnik describes how imagination contributes to the vast amount of knowledge that children acquire in their first few years. Accumulated knowledge allows children to think of alternative ways that the world could be, which in turn helps them construct mental maps of the causal relationships that govern and explain how things work. Imagination also aids them in forming ideas about how other people think and act. Many children have 'imaginary friends'; their ability to understand others and to change themselves is aided by the possibilities for exploring alternatives that such play affords.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>This learning proceeds by experimentation and recognition of statistical patterns.

Children appear to have a far more vivid awareness of the world around them than adults because an adult's 'spotlight awareness' that enables concentration on specific features of an environment involves losing the 'lantern awareness' that brings the whole environment to the forefront of attention. This childhood form of awareness is likened by Gopnik to how adults feel when they visit a foreign country; they focus less on particulars and experience everything more globally because of unfamiliarity. But if children have a more intense lantern awareness, they also have less inner consciousness of the kind that helps manufacture a distinctive sense of self, that autobiographical centre of memory and planning which is the 'me' in all experience.

We need only turn to the comic strip Peanuts, where his instantly recognizable bust glowers over Lucy's hopeless flirtations with Schroeder, the toy-piano prodigy. Beethoven's celebrity status is nothing new: in 1827, fourteen-year-old Richard Wagner attended a concert at the Leipzig Gewandhaus featuring the recently deceased master's Seventh Symphony. The music moved Wagner profoundly, but, as he wrote in his autobiography, his feeling of awe was enhanced by 'the added impact of Beethoven's physiognomy, as shown by lithographs of the time, as well as the knowledge of his deafness and his solitary and withdrawn life. There soon arose in me an image of the highest supernal originality, beyond comparison with anything.'<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Beethoven's remarkably enduring fame is evidence of the 'cultural supremacy' music enjoys in the modern West. Over the past two hundred years, musicians have achieved levels of celebrity, fortune, and cultural influence unmatched by practitioners of any other art. This triumph is the result of a set of interlocking historical developments, all of which began in the 1700s: the emergence of a new kind of audience for the arts, a shift in aesthetic sensibilities, a consequent change in the status of artists, and a wave of technological development spurred by industrialization.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>The cult of Beethoven is a typical product of this perfect storm of historical circumstances. In the second half of the eighteenth century, it became possible for composers and other musicians to make a living without depending entirely on aristocratic patronage: there was now a growing urban audience, which included a non-noble middle class, willing to pay to attend concerts in large halls like the Gewandhaus. As the role of this urban public increased, Romanticism emerged as the dominant artistic sensibility. Great art, the conventional wisdom now held, was above all innovative and expressive; 'supernal originality' in personal conduct and appearance was typical of the superior beings capable of producing such works. Technological improvements in lithography and a dramatic proliferation of print media intensified these other developments, transforming a select group of charismatic musicians from mere courtly servants into universally recognized icons.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Every social upheaval, economic transformation, intellectual development, and technological novelty of the past two and a half centuries has served to increase music's reach, influence and prestige. Today, music pervades many aspects of our daily lives, from the most public to the most intimate. Successful musicians enjoy unprecedented wealth and wield a unique cultural power that reflects the wide diffusion of their work. Over the past two hundred years, music has acquired a steadily growing place in Western culture. This would have been inconceivable without the aesthetic sea change Romanticism made possible. Every time one of us plugs in to an iPod or turns on the radio, it becomes that much clearer just how deeply music has penetrated our daily lives, and how enduring its presence there will be.<\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":0,"NegativePoints":0,"Explanation":"<p>All the given options are correct.

I must repeat briefly here that painters are broadly divisible into three classes: first, the large class who are more or less affected or false in all their work, and whose productions, however dexterous, are of no value whatever; secondly, the literally true painters, who copy with various feeling but unanimously honest purpose, the actualities of Nature, but can only paint them as they see them, without selection or arrangement; lastly, the inventive painters, who are not only true in all they do, but compose and relive the truths they paint, so as to give to each the utmost possible value. The last class is in all ages a very small one.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>That Millais belongs to the last class was very visible in his works last year; a new power of conception being proved in them - to instance two things among many - by the arrangement of the myrtle branches in 'Peace', and the play of the colours in the heap of 'Autumn Leaves'.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>I have not patience much to examine the meaning of the picture under consideration.

All this, and much more than this - for the picture might be otherwise suggestive to us in a thousand ways - it would have brought home at once to the heart for every spectator, had the idea but been realized with any steadiness of purpose or veracity of detail.

In the experiment, 30 subjects were presented with a series of happy or sad musical excerpts. After listening to the snippets, the subjects were shown a photograph of a face. Some people were shown a happy face - the person was smiling - while others were exposed to a sad or neutral facial expression. The participants were then asked to rate the emotional content of the face on a 7-point scale, where 1 mean extremely sad and 7 extremely happy.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>The researchers found that music powerfully influenced the emotional ratings of the faces. Happy music made happy faces seem even happier while sad music exaggerated the melancholy of a frown. A similar effect was also observed with neutral faces. The simple moral is that the emotions of music are 'cross-modal', and can easily spread from one sensory system to another.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Although it probably seems obvious that music can evoke emotions, it is to this day not clear why. Why doesn't music feel like listening to speech sounds, or animal calls, or garbage disposals? Why is music nice to listen to? Why does music get blessed with a multi-billion dollar industry, whereas there is no market for 'easy listening' speech sounds?<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Music is exquisitely emotionally evocative, which is why a touch of happy music makes even unrelated pictures seem more pleasant. It would be plausible to conclude that the artefact of music should contain some distinctly human elements.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>The question, of course, is what those elements are. One candidate is our expressive speech - perhaps music is just an abstract form of language. However, most of the emotion of language is in the meaning, which is why foreign languages that we don't understand rarely make us swoon with pleasure or get angry. That's also why emotional speech from an unfamiliar language isn't featured on the radio!<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>But there is a second auditory expressive behaviour we humans carry out - our bodily movements themselves. Human movement has been conjectured to underlie music as far back as the Greeks. As a hypothesis this has the advantage that we have auditory systems capable of making sense of the sounds of people moving in our midst. Some of these movements trigger positive emotions - they conjure up images of pleasant activities - while others might be automatically associated with fear or anxiety. (The sound of running makes us wonder what we're running from.) If music were speech-driven, then it is missing out on the largest part of speech's expressiveness - the meaning. But if music sounds like human expressive movements, then it sounds like something that, all by itself, is rich in emotional expressiveness, and can be easily interpreted by the auditory system.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Regardless of whether music is emotional intonation from speech or a summary of expressive movements - or something else altogether - the new research by Logeswaran and Bhattacharya adds yet more fuel to the expectation that music has been culturally selected to sound like an emotionally expressive human. While it is not easy for us to see the human ingredients in the modulations of pitch, intensity, tempo and rhythm that make music, perhaps it is obvious to our auditory homunculus.<\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":0,"NegativePoints":0,"Explanation":"<p>Option [2] is incorrect - even if music was created by stringing several kinds of sound together, it does not imply that it cannot be a summary of human movements. The fact that it may express human movements has nothing to do with the way in which it was created. The same is the case with [3] - a distinction between vocal and instrumental music cannot be drawn to show that music is not based on human movements. [4] is also wrong because the chain of ideas expressed in the passage do not relate to the intellectual benefits of listening to a particular kind of music. The theme of the passage is about the effect that music has on human beings, and the reasons behind this, and not about the intellectual benefits derivable from any particular kind of music.

Catalytic mechanisms share five distinct characteristics - a catalytic mechanism produces desired results in unpredictable ways; a catalytic mechanism distributes power for the benefit of the overall system, often to the great discomfort of those who traditionally hold power; a catalytic mechanism has a sharp set of teeth; it attracts the right people and ejects viruses; it produces an ongoing effect.<\/p><p><br \/>My research has focused on the impact of catalytic mechanisms in organizational settings - on how they can turn a company's most ambitious goals into reality. But catalytic mechanisms can also have a powerful impact on individuals. Indeed, I have made catalytic mechanisms a fundamental part of how I manage my time with my 'come to Boulder rule' and 'four day rule'.<br \/> <br \/>I am not alone. Several of my former students at Stanford Business School have applied a catalytic mechanism to reach their goals. In one case, a former student created a personal board of directors composed of people he admires and would not want to disappoint, and he made a personal commitment to follow the board's guidance - it has power in his life. In 1996, he wrote to me: 'I recently used my personal board in deciding whether to leave Morgan Stanley and go to work with a friend in his two year-old business. \"Yes\"\u009d was the unanimous vote'. So despite the risk of leaving a lucrative and prestigious position, he leapt into the small company, which has since grown fourfold to employ more than 80 people.<br \/> <br \/>Consider also the highly effective catalytic mechanism that a colleague of mine has been using for the past three years to attain her BHAG: to lead a full and active life as a mother, wife, professional writer and church-volunteer without going crazy. That part about maintaining sanity is important because before her catalytic mechanism was in place, my colleague constantly found herself overextended and miserable. The main culprit was her work as a freelance writer: she accepted too many jobs. 'Not surprisingly, the woman's children paid the price of her constant working as did her husband and close-knit extended family. One day, my colleague was lamenting her situation to her sister, who came up with an effective catalytic mechanism. Every time the woman took on work beyond a certain level of revenue - a comfortable annual salary, in essence - she would pay her sister a $ 200-a-day penalty fee. My colleague, instantly seeing the wonderful impact of the plan immediately agreed.<br \/> <br \/>Since she redistributed power to her sister, my colleague has gained new control over her life. Now she happily accepts jobs up to a certain level of income, but she assesses each additional offer with newly critical eyes. (She has taken on extra work on only two occasions; both projects were too lucrative to pass up.)<br \/> <br \/>Would any of these people have changed their lives without catalytic mechanisms? Perhaps, but I think it less likely. Personal catalytic mechanisms have all the benefits of organizational mechanisms.

No one has ever observed what happens when a language is used for a century in a global village. Predicting the course of language over long periods of time is about as easy as predicting the weather. But here are some guesses.<\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><strong><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">English will not drive other languages to extinction, and may not even survive as the world's lingua franca.<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">&nbsp;Today one out of five earthlings speaks some English, and many of the rest want to learn it. But the fate of Latin (once the Western world's lingua franca, now a dead language) reminds us that the reign of English may be short. English is dominant not because it is inherently superior but because it is the main language of science and technology, of the Internet, of popular culture and of international business and law.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\">Any language, however, can be adapted to modern needs. The convenience of English trades off against pride in the local language, as we see in Quebec, where the language police are intent on maintaining French as the dominant language. The Internet is becoming polyglot, and with improving translation engines, English will not be indispensable much longer on the Web. Sensitive to local tastes, CNN and MTV now produce programming in other languages.<\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><strong><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">Regional accents and dialects will persist.<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">&nbsp;English speakers will not all sound like American television announcers because children do not learn their accents from television announcers. Children acquire accents from other children, and usually keep them for a lifetime. Though some dialects have died and others have changed, the major American accents are going strong.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><strong><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">Internet communication will not ruin the language.<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"color: windowtext;\"> The typo-infested, acronym-speckled epistles that fill our electronic mailboxes will not fatally infect speech and writing. A century ago, the telegraph did not lead people to omit prepositions from their speech or end every sentence with 'STOP'. People adjust their language depending on whom they are addressing (children or spouses, friends or strangers) and how they want to sound (casual or official, orotund or businesslike).<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><strong><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">English will change, but not deteriorate.<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"color: windowtext;\"> Plaints about the imminent demise of the language are made in every century. But there is usually nothing inherently wrong with most changes the purists deplore. Young Californians' uptalk (sentences that sound like questions) is no more pusillanimous or noncommittal than Canadians' habitual 'eh?'<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">Even seemingly defensible complaints can, in hindsight, be seen to have missed the mark. An old edition of William Strunk and E. B. White's style manual, justly concerned about bureaucratese, said 'Never tack \"ize\"\u009d onto a noun to create a verb. \"&brvbar; Why use moisturize when there is the simple, unpretentious word moisten?' Had Strunk or White consulted with someone who actually used moisturizer, their question would have been answered. Moisten means 'put water on X, making X moist for seconds'. Moisturize means 'rub viscous fluid into X, making X moist for hours'.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">Their prescription, if followed, would have impoverished the language. Central planning of language, as of so many other endeavours, is bound to be less responsive to human needs than the collective genius of millions of minds making individual decisions based on local information. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;\"><strong>English will continue to change, eventually beyond recognition.<\/strong> As the centuries pass, our descendants will find our writings quaint, then difficult, then unintelligible without a translator. If you find this depressing, remember that it is the price we pay for the certainty that our descendants will have a complex, articulate language. A language is not a finite resource or precious artefact in need of vigilant protection lest it wear away, fall apart or get used up.

Gazing upon the ruins of Maya temples Stephens conjured up in his imagination a world of 'orators, warriors and statesmen'. Yet if he'd rashly 'called back into life' some of the people painted on the wall he could have got a surprise. He might have found they weren't so much 'gazing in sadness' as contorted with pain. Archaeologists for a long time believed the ancient Maya to be gentle and peaceful people, although why archaeologists should have held this belief, beyond their customary wishful thinking, it is not clear. We now know that Maya warfare was intense, chronic and unresolvable, and that the sadness Stephens detected long ago was due to some very nasty customs indeed, such as innovative forms of torture and human sacrifice.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>I suppose it all depends on what you expect a civilization to offer. The Maya, and the Aztecs too, offered barbarism plus pyramids. Personally I don't think that's enough.

In the first part of the book, Foucault describes sovereign power as that form of power expressed in recognizable ways through particular and identifiable individuals. The 'nodes' of this form of power are the king, the prince, and the agents thereof. When sovereign power operates, we know that we have been acted upon; in what ways; and by whom. It is more difficult to ascertain the precise nature of disciplinary power since one of its distinguishing features is the swiftness and lightness with which it acts, thus rendering it substantially less visible than sovereign power.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>First of all, the disciplinary society controls not through the direct application of power by the sovereign or his agent, but through an impersonal and invisible gaze. The efficiency of disciplinary power is closely related to its invisibility compared with the visible sovereign. Its totalizing power lies precisely in its universal potentiality, combined with the impossibility of verifiability.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>The second advantage gained when the dominant form of power shifted from sovereign to disciplinary results from the key elements of its effectiveness: lightness, speed and subtlety, which result in invisibility. This invisibility of disciplinary power makes resistance and\/or revolt against it substantially less likely and more difficult than was the case with sovereign power.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>We are shaped through the coercion of disciplinary power, but unaware of the shaping. This is the importance of its lightness and its speed; we are deprived of the opportunity for resistance, and once effectively shaped, we have no desire to revolt. To the extent that disciplinary power operates according to its potential, we can never verify that we have been disciplined, and we are always being disciplined. However, this level of efficiency is never realized; we live in a disciplinary society, not a disciplined one.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>This brings us to a third advantage of disciplinary power over sovereign power: its constant operation. Power is only effective when it acts and sovereign power only acts at particular moments. The opposite is true for disciplinary power. Since it operates continually, its effects are theoretically limitless. The control over the individual exercised by disciplinary power is thus not only more effective but also more totalizing, in the sense that it is more fine-grained in its effect.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Disciplinary power creates and informs the human sciences which do the work of defining our human 'normality', that is, individuals who conform to certain standards of sanity, health, docility, competence, and so on. But to have meaning, normalization requires something more than this: 'normal' must be measured and defined in order to exert an influence on individuals. This is the role of the examination in the disciplinary society. The examination is the disciplinary technology that allows for a clear and precise measurement of those attributes which power deems important enough to order and manage.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>And this process of normalization then serves the ordering function of power, as it helps create individuals of a certain type. And the invisibility and lightness of the operation of this form of power leads the subjects to confuse the 'normal' with the 'natural'. That is, the defined and desired 'normality' is not seen as a product of power's operation; it is seen as a 'true' measurement of the way the world 'is'.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>The disciplinary society seeks, by its totalizing nature, to direct and control all aspects of the lives of all the subject-selves it constitutes. Only thus can all energy be devoted to productive pursuits; only thus can all subjects be properly constituted and supervised. It is a matter of efficiency: undisciplined expenditure of energy is not productive, and it is only through constant surveillance that such wastefulness can be prevented. 'Discipline is no longer simply an art of distributing bodies, of extracting time from them and accumulating it, but of composing forces in order to obtain an efficient machine.'<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>More radically, among the things that are produced are a certain type of productive time and a certain type of productive individual: 'Instead of being locked away, hidden, the body was made visible and carefully scrutinized; instead of being tortured, it was programmed and exercised; instead of its simply being placed in servitude, its activities were reconstituted for efficiency and productivity.'<\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":0,"NegativePoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span> Refer\r\n  to paragraph 3.

In the first part of the book, Foucault describes sovereign power as that form of power expressed in recognizable ways through particular and identifiable individuals. The 'nodes' of this form of power are the king, the prince, and the agents thereof. When sovereign power operates, we know that we have been acted upon; in what ways; and by whom. It is more difficult to ascertain the precise nature of disciplinary power since one of its distinguishing features is the swiftness and lightness with which it acts, thus rendering it substantially less visible than sovereign power.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>First of all, the disciplinary society controls not through the direct application of power by the sovereign or his agent, but through an impersonal and invisible gaze. The efficiency of disciplinary power is closely related to its invisibility compared with the visible sovereign. Its totalizing power lies precisely in its universal potentiality, combined with the impossibility of verifiability.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>The second advantage gained when the dominant form of power shifted from sovereign to disciplinary results from the key elements of its effectiveness: lightness, speed and subtlety, which result in invisibility. This invisibility of disciplinary power makes resistance and\/or revolt against it substantially less likely and more difficult than was the case with sovereign power.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>We are shaped through the coercion of disciplinary power, but unaware of the shaping. This is the importance of its lightness and its speed; we are deprived of the opportunity for resistance, and once effectively shaped, we have no desire to revolt. To the extent that disciplinary power operates according to its potential, we can never verify that we have been disciplined, and we are always being disciplined. However, this level of efficiency is never realized; we live in a disciplinary society, not a disciplined one.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>This brings us to a third advantage of disciplinary power over sovereign power: its constant operation. Power is only effective when it acts and sovereign power only acts at particular moments. The opposite is true for disciplinary power. Since it operates continually, its effects are theoretically limitless. The control over the individual exercised by disciplinary power is thus not only more effective but also more totalizing, in the sense that it is more fine-grained in its effect.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Disciplinary power creates and informs the human sciences which do the work of defining our human 'normality', that is, individuals who conform to certain standards of sanity, health, docility, competence, and so on. But to have meaning, normalization requires something more than this: 'normal' must be measured and defined in order to exert an influence on individuals. This is the role of the examination in the disciplinary society. The examination is the disciplinary technology that allows for a clear and precise measurement of those attributes which power deems important enough to order and manage.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>And this process of normalization then serves the ordering function of power, as it helps create individuals of a certain type. And the invisibility and lightness of the operation of this form of power leads the subjects to confuse the 'normal' with the 'natural'.

Each bead of this mantra is significant and makes some sense. Some beads might even contain powerful, perhaps even immortal, magic. But this interminable mantra, as a whole, is nothing but mumbo-jumbo mumbled by a West that wants to be radical without feeling seriously inconvenienced.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>The West has increasingly turned its gaze onto itself in recent years. There it stands in front of gilded mirrors, gazing at itself in admiration. What it sees is no longer the whiteness it saw in the far past. What it sees now is multi-hued, variously dressed, many voiced. For, the Western self, particularly in literary and cultural circles, has long accepted the fact of being creolized. When the West gazes into its mirrors, it sees its own new post-war multicultural self. It sees Salman Rushdie, V.S. Naipaul, Hari Kunzru, Zadie Smith. And it likes to pretend that it is seeing the Other.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>I am not accusing Rushdie and Naipaul of bland mimicry or of consciously catering to Western opinions. These, and many others like them, are excellent writers, and people of much independence of thought and posture. And yet, they belong to a tradition that is less uncomfortable for the cultured Western reader and critic to face up to. If they present difference, they present just a different aspect of the West.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Choice of language, of course, is one hammer used to strike at such authors. I refuse to take up that hammer. What if they write in English or French? Only a dishonest critic would use that forced\/free choice to dismiss the work of a writer, for what language has not been the language of the oppressor? And, by the same token, what language cannot be used to resist, at least to a degree, the commands of the oppressor? I repeat my observation: they are a reflection of the new post-war multi-cultural West. They are the mirror images that make the liberal West feel comfortable with itself, because it feels that in gazing on them (and their works) it is reading and championing the Other.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Literary trends, such as magical realism, which are fashionable in the West are used to define, collate and celebrate this 'global' literature, even within the already narrow circumference of legitimating European languages. African or Asian novelists who experiment with structure or connect to the modernist tradition are not likely to be promoted. Instead, preference is given to 'story-telling', to 'magical realism' etc.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>There are other 'global' literatures, but they are not visible today. Some of them are even in English or French or Spanish. Some of them are even by authors settled or born in the West. But gilded mirrors are not likely to reflect them. Just as there are other Asian, African, post-colonial writers, but they are hardly visible today.

These sentimental, sometimes frivolous, and suitably 'feminine' themes from contemporary and antique poetry, and her elegant portraits of English and Continental aristocrats, have reinforced the image and expectations of the types of art a woman artist in the eighteenth century would have produced.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>During her lifetime Kauffman also had a considerable reputation as a history painter. In the eighteenth century, painting was considered the highest branch of art. Its themes included dramatic events visualized through narratives based on scripture, mythology, classical and modern literature, and history, and it was considered the pictorial equivalent to the literary forms of epic and tragedy.

As a Presiding Officer at public hearings across the country, I was looking forward to preaching about the evils of child marriages. After having attended almost half a dozen public hearings across the country in states as diverse as Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, I realize that the reality is more complex than what it seems to be when one sits in one's office.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>A marriage in rural India is not just a relationship between two individuals. Marriages form the backbone of the networking that is essential for survival in a world where the idea of state providing protection seems an alien concept. The urban mind tends to ignore this concept of marriage and looks at marriage in its Western form. In Europe and America, marriage is a licence to have sex and procreate. In all communities where child marriages are prevalent, the sexual aspect of marriage is absent at the time of marriage.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>In fact a child marriage is so essentially different from a normal marriage, that it should be called an engagement rather than a marriage. After such a marriage, the girl does not go with her husband. She continues to live with her parents. The marriage is not consummated for many years. When the girl and the boy attain maturity, another ceremony (called Gauna in North India) is held. It is only after Gauna that the girl can meet her husband.
