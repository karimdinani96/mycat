If they do, there is no need to kill the chiru to collect its wool. The wool can be harvested repeatedly.

Scientific evidence of unequivocal superiority of CNG over other fuels is not established. The evidence that we do have about CNG vehicles is from outside India. No experiments have been conducted on the implications of CNG use in Indian conditions, not just the climate, but also the technology, structure, and myriad uses of Indian buses, taxis, and autos. The precautionary principle, waved at issues from global warming to genetically modified food, is set aside.<br \/><br \/>More astonishingly, no such experiments have even been demanded.

And no one can doubt the frequent efficiency of compensatory power, of reward in the form of clothing, jewellery, equipage, housing, entertainment, and participation in social observances. These have long and adequately demonstrated their utility in securing feminine compliance with masculine will.<\/p><p>However, it will be evident on brief thought, that male power and female submission have relied much more completely on the belief since ancient times that such submission is the natural order of things. Men might love, honour and cherish. It was for long accepted that women should love honour, and obey. Some of this was the product of specific education \u2013 of institution at home, in the schools, and from the Church as to the proper role of women in the social order and in relation to the family. Until recently, courses in universities and colleges taught women but not men the homely arts \u2013 home economics and homemaking \u2013 with a strong implication that this was relevant to a normal submission to male will. Such implication in this form of instruction has not entirely disappeared.<\/p><p>Conditioned power is the product of a continuum from objective, visible persuasion to what the individual in the social context has been brought to believe is inherently correct. As we have seen, such power can be explicit, the result of a direct and viable attempt to win the belief that, in turn, reflects the purposes of the individual or group seeking or exercising the power. Or the belief can be implicit in the social or cultural condition; submission to the authority of others reflects the accepted view of what the individual should do. As one moves from explicit to implicit conditioning, one passes from obtrusive, ostentatious effort to win belief to an imposed subordination that is unnoticed \u2013 taken for granted. And, an important point, the social acceptance of conditioned power rises steadily as one moves in this direction from explicit to implicit conditioning.<\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":false,"Points":0,"NegativePoints":0,"Explanation":"<p>Refer to paragraph 2 that outlines the various ways in which compensatory power can be established.

The belief is based on fossil data: animal fossils tended to be sparse in deposits formed prior to the Cambrian period, and abundant thereafter. The Cambrian explosion, if true, is also extremely puzzling, because conventional thinking does not fit in well with the possibility of radical evolutionary developments taking place within relatively brief intervals of time (here \u2018brief\u2019 is to be understood in a geological time-frame: 10 million years would certainly qualify). <br \/><br \/>A spectacular finding, made recently by Shuhai Xiao and colleagues at the Harvard and Beijing Universities, undermines the sanctity of the Cambrian explosion theory. The researchers have reported the existence of superbly preserved animal embryos in the Doushantuo phosphate deposits in southern China. The stratum is 570 million years old approximately, and the complexity of the embryos suggest that their evolutionary ancestry must be far older than would have been guessed hitherto. This may also mark the beginning of a rapprochement between palaeontologists, (whose best estimates of the time of divergence of the animal phyla was 565 million years ago) and molecular biologists, who had inferred (on the basis of DNA sequence analysis) that the time of divergence had to be at least 1,000 million years ago.<br \/><br \/>The fossils identified by Xiao and colleagues are spherical and about half a millimetre in diameter. They are broken into 2, 4, or 8 sub-units that look exactly like dividing animal embryos. The overall size of the fossils is the same \u201cirrespective of how many sub-units\u201d they contain, reinforcing the inference that they were indeed embryos \u2013 initial embryonic development is not accompanied by increase in size \u2013 and not crystalline aggregations of inert matter, for example.<br \/><br \/>These fossilised embryos confirm in their appearance, an old theory due to Hackel, that in the beginning, multi-cellular animals must have been microscopic creatures that resembled the embryos of the animals of today. Multi-cellular algal fossils have been dated to about 1,000 million years ago, and the present work indicates a similar age for animal fossils too. As the authors point out, Doushantuo embryos constitute the first geological evidence in support of the hypothesis that the chief lineages of multi-cellular life diversified much before large animals came on the scene.

By one estimate, construction,\u00a0buying, selling and renting of properties and the imputed benefits to owner-occupier's\u00a0account for around 15% of rich countries\u2019 GDP. The property also makes up around two-thirds of the tangible capital stock in most economies. Most important of all, the property\u00a0is by far the world's biggest single asset class. Investors have much more money tied\u00a0up in property than in shares or bonds.<\/p><p>Yet, curiously, there has been much less economic research into the property market\u00a0than into the stockmarket, the bond market or the foreign-exchange market. One reason\u00a0is that until recently much of this property investment was held fairly passively. For most\u00a0people a home was simply a place to live. For most firms offices were a necessary\u00a0but relatively unimportant part of their infrastructure. Commercial property made up less\u00a0than 5% of most institutional investors' portfolios. But now many people, having lost faith\u00a0in shares, see their home as an investment that will appreciate rapidly in value. Financial\u00a0institutions are also pushing up the share of commercial property in their portfolios. To\u00a0both sorts of investor, property seems to offer attractively high returns as well as a\u00a0safe haven in an increasingly risky world.<\/p><p>Over the past few years, house prices have been booming almost everywhere except\u00a0Germany and Japan. Since the mid-1990s, house prices in Australia, Britain, Ireland,\u00a0the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden have all risen by more than 50% in real terms.\u00a0American house prices are up a more modest 30%, but that is still the biggest real\u00a0gain over any such period in recorded history. Commercial-property prices in some big\u00a0cities have also been looking rather frothy. These property booms have been partly driven\u00a0by economic fundamentals, but bubble-like symptoms abound. How long can the party last? Estate agents, builders, lenders, many economists and even Alan Greenspan, chairman of America's Federal Reserve, have all insisted that there is no house-price bubble. Rising house prices, the argument goes, are fully justified by low interest rates, rising real incomes, growing populations and a fixed supply of land. But this sounds a little like the \"wall of money\" argument used to defend inflated share prices in the late 1990s. Prices had to rise, it was said, because the number of shares in which pension funds could invest their billions was limited. Investors mistakenly\u00a0came to believe that the traditional link between share prices and profits no longer mattered.\u00a0Home-owners may be making a similar mistake today. It is often argued that property is a much safer investment than shares because a share is just a (possibly worthless) piece of paper, whereas bricks and mortar are something tangible. Yet that tells us nothing about their relative value. Bubbles form when the price of any asset gets out of line with its underlying value.<\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":false,"Points":0,"NegativePoints":0,"Explanation":"<p>Option [1] is encouraging the reader to invest in property by talking about the advantages of the same.

It works in the minutest crannies and it opens out the widest vistas. It 'bakes no bread', but it can inspire our souls with courage. These illuminations at least, and the contrast effects of darkness and mystery that accompany them, give to what it says an interest that is much more than professional.<\/p><p>The history of philosophy to a great extent is that of a certain clash of human temperament. Of whatever temperament a professional philosopher is, he tries when philosophizing to sink the fact of his temperament. Temperament is no conventionally recognized reason, so he urges impersonal reasons only for his conclusions. Yet his temperament really gives him a stronger bias than any of his more strictly objective premises. It loads the evidence for him one way or the other, making for a more sentimental or a more hard-hearted view of the universe, just as this fact or that principle would. He trusts his temperament. Wanting a universe that suits it, he believes in any representation of the universe that does suit it. He feels men of opposite temper to be out of key with the world's character, and in his heart considers them incompetent and 'not in it', in the philosophic business, even though they may far excel him in dialectical ability.<br \/><br \/>Yet in the forum, he can make no claim, on the bare ground of his temperament, to superior discernment or authority. There arises thus a certain insincerity in our philosophic discussions: the most potent of all our premises is never mentioned. Very positively marked men, men of radical idiosyncrasy, who have set their stamp and likeness on philosophy and figure in its history: Plato, Locke, Hegel, Spencer, are such temperamental thinkers. Most of us have, of course, no very definite intellectual temperament; we are a mixture of opposite ingredients, each one present very moderately.<br \/><br \/>Now one particular difference of temperament is one that has counted in literature, art, government and manners as well as in philosophy. In manners, we find formalists and free and easy persons. In government, authoritarians and anarchists. In literature, purists or academics, and realists. In art, classics and romantics. You recognize these contrasts as familiar; well, in philosophy we have a very similar contrast that covers all these: expressed in the pair of terms 'rationalist' and 'empiricist', 'empiricist' meaning your lover of facts in all their crude variety, 'rationalist' meaning your devotee to abstract and eternal principles. No one can live an hour without both facts and principles, so it is a difference rather of emphasis, yet it breeds antipathies of the most pungent character between those who lay the emphasis differently; and we shall find it extraordinarily convenient to express a certain contrast in men's ways of taking their universe, by talking of the 'empiricist' and of the 'rationalist' temper. These terms make the contrast simple and massive.<br \/><br \/>Rationalism is always monistic. It starts from wholes and universals and makes much of the unity of things. Empiricism starts from the parts, and makes of the whole a collection - is not averse therefore to calling itself pluralistic. Rationalism usually considers itself more religious than empiricism, but there is much to say about this claim. It is a true claim when the individual rationalist is what is called a man of feeling, and when the individual empiricist prides himself on being hard-headed.<\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":false,"Points":0,"NegativePoints":0,"Explanation":"<p>Refer to the last paragraph.

But what if there were a way to halt this terrifying decline? What if scientists developed a treatment that could somehow stop Alzheimer's disease in its tracks and prevent any further deterioration? Chances are you'd want to treat folks as soon as possible, in the earliest stages of the disease, long before devastating brain damage occurs.<\/p><p>Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, disclosed what may be an important step towards that goal. In a study that was published in the March issue of the Archives of Neurology, they provided compelling evidence that a condition called mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, which is characterized by repeated lapses in short-term memory, is in fact in many patients the earliest stage of Alzheimer's disease.<br \/> <br \/>Should the Washington University findings hold up, they could eventually provide drug companies with another target for treating or even preventing Alzheimer's. Perhaps more immediately, however, the results could trigger all sorts of financial and legal headaches if, for example, insurance companies start labelling mild cognitive impairment as a pre-existing condition that disqualifies patients from long-term health-care coverage. This is apart from the emotional trauma of patients realizing that they probably have an incurable disorder.<br \/> <br \/>The clinical view of MCI deals with distinct changes in forgetfulness over a period of a year or two - changes that can be verified with psychological testing. \"People start at different points,\"\u009d says Neil Buckholtz, chief of the dementias branch at the National Institute on Ageing. \"Everybody forgets where they put their keys. But if you forget what keys are for, that could be a concern.\"\u009d<br \/> <br \/>Of course, when Dr. John Morris and his colleagues at Washington University set out on their study 10 years ago, they didn't have much information to guide them. They pulled together a group of 404 men and women between the ages of 45 and 103 and gave them a battery of psychological and memory tests. Nearly 230 study subjects had various levels of what we would now recognize as MCI. The rest had normal scores for their age and served as the control group.<br \/> <br \/>At least five therapies are now being studied around the world for their potential in treating MCI. Among the candidate treatments are vitamin E, anti-inflammatory medications called cox-2 inhibitors and the Alzheimer's drug Aricept. The first results aren't expected for three to four years.<br \/> <br \/>Until then, doctors are likely to proceed fairly cautiously. They want to make sure they're helping their MCI patients without unnecessarily stigmatizing them with the Alzheimer's label. Still, there's hope, says Dr. Ronald Petersen, director of the Alzheimer's Researcher Centre at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. \"These people are really quite functional.\"\u009d For if MCI is indeed the earliest stage of Alzheimer's disease, and if it's possible to slow its progression, patients might be able to delay the onset of full-blown Alzheimer's and preserve a fairly decent quality of life.<\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":false,"Points":0,"NegativePoints":0,"Explanation":"<p>Options [1] and [2] can be mere absent-mindedness whereas option [3] is a serious issue.

The rational ego is posited as the subject of knowledge in modern science and technology, animating the utopian projects of industrial civilization, and culminating in great urban conglomerates as the sealed universe of commodities, which constitute the omnipresent 'mall'. Let us try and analyze how this new wave is changing or is likely to change our environment, our social and economic order and us.<\/p><p>Consumerism is economically manifested in the increased and chronic purchasing of new goods and services, with little attention to their true need, durability, product origin or the environmental consequences of manufacture and disposal. Consumerism is driven by colossal spends on advertising. Materialism is an obvious outcome of consumerism. Malls as an entity have one raison d'\u00c3\u00aatre, i.e. promotion of materialism.<br \/> <br \/>Consumerism interferes with the workings of society by replacing the normal desire for an adequate supply of life's necessities with little regard for the true utility of what is bought. An intended consequence of this, promoted by those who profit from consumerism, is to accelerate the discarding of the old, either because of lack of durability or a change in fashion. Cheap discarded products that fail early and cannot be repaired go into landfills to make more ground on which you stand.<br \/> <br \/>Consumerism sets each person against himself in an endless quest for the attainment of material things or the imaginary world conjured up and made promising by things yet to be purchased.<br \/> <br \/>Malls in India have been making headlines for quite some time now. The urban landscape of India is forever being altered: with the economy bubbling and booming, and with money to splurge, buying and thus our living, is being redirected to that of a virtual consumerist onslaught.<br \/> <br \/>Despite being a new concept that has just been flagged off, malls already seem to draw the largest crowds. It is evident that neither the market, nor the purchasing has reached a level of maturity to match the exorbitance of the price tags. After all, if the bulk of mall-goers don't shop - and there have been studies to show that only 10-15 per cent of mall visitors end up buying anything - supply-demand economics will wield its scalpel on the urban cultural landscape.<br \/> <br \/>It is also true that malls have certain advantages for us as individuals and a country: the joy that at last there's a place where anyone can walk to take a peek at 21st century India. So what if it's not the real thing? The fact that it's there to slink into is no mean thing. It has actually created a league of organized labour with professional operations systems in place. It has at least started setting a precedent of tidiness for Indians who need some models to aspire to.<br \/> <br \/>The mall is the urban utopia that exists 'quarantined' from the rest of the country. For a city that dissuades people from walking, and one that not always succeeds in convincing us that life is far better than it really is, the mall is a boulevard not only for the urban stroller - the Baudelarian flacneur - but also for the dreamer and pretender.<br \/> <br \/>All of us had imagined as kids what 2005 would look like. Nothing really matches it. Except the mall, that is. And the best part is they are all air-conditioned. Whether the revenue they generate can bring equanimity, and whether India will actually see more people having access to three square meals a day, a roof over their heads, basic education, and means of livelihood, remains to be seen.<\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":false,"Points":0,"NegativePoints":0,"Explanation":"<p>Option [1] is the most comprehensive, covering all areas of the passage which talk both of malls and of misplaced priorities.
