No doubt there are scientific discussions to be had about the problems of global warming, nuclear war and engineered viruses. But science starts with what is known, and works outwards from there. Precaution works in the opposite direction: it starts from the unknown, where, by definition, science is helpless. That is what makes precaution an unscientific approach.<\/p><p>We will only get to a destination like Mars if we are driven by a positive vision and purpose, such as the quest for knowledge. Looking for life on Mars is one such quest. If Mars has life, even bacterial life, which is independent of life forms on Earth, then it will show that life arises easily and is most likely spread across the universe. If life is found that somehow relates to life as we know it on Earth, that will suggest that life can survive the journey through space - and also raise the possibility that life came to Earth from outside. If Mars is found to be barren, it will shorten the odds that the Earth is truly unique.<\/p><p>It is people who have a passion for such knowledge who will make a mission to Mars a reality - people who are consumed by the need to know; who are tormented by the limitations of robot explorers; for whom pictures of red rocks are simply not enough. It is those who have new ideas for new experiments on Mars, and who cannot wait years for the next robotic lander to get there, who will make the case for humans venturing there instead. In short, a positive view of humanity might spur us to further explore space, whereas arguments for space travel as a means of saving us from our own self-destructive tendencies are likely to have the unintended consequence of making us less willing to explore and take risks.<\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":false,"Points":0,"NegativePoints":0,"Explanation":"<p>While the first part of [1] is true, the second is not - the author does not claim that the predicted disastrous scenarios are unlikely; he is upset because Hawking uses these negative reasons to justify a positive action plan.

And in order to survive that disaster, he argued, we will have to 'spread out into space', travelling to the moon and Mars.<\/p><p>'Eminent scientist predicts end of the world' is hardly shocking news anymore. So which of the alleged threats to mankind has got Hawking hot under the collar? A meteorite strike? Avian flu? Cancer-causing chemicals? Actually, he's more worried about 'sudden global warming', nuclear war and genetically engineered viruses. There is no shortage of apocalypse scenarios these days.<\/p><p>Two aspects of Hawking's speech are noteworthy. The first is that he, like many other scientists and public figures today, seems capable of putting the case for progress (in this case, space travel) only by flagging up the doom and disaster that will occur if we don't take that progressive path. So instead of arguing that humans should conquer and colonize space because it is in our nature to explore and because that would enable us to expand and develop, he posits space travel as a way of escaping almost certain disaster on a planet that we have apparently already ruined.<\/p><p>The second noteworthy thing is how Hawking completed his list of potential catastrophes: apparently we are in peril from 'other dangers we have not yet thought of'. Well, perhaps - and perhaps not. It's a bit hard to say much more about dangers that we have not yet thought of.<\/p><p>'Dangers we have not yet thought of' are surely the realm, not of science, but of the precautionary principle. It seems that what is animating Hawking's concerns, and the concerns of so many others these days, is not a scientific analysis but a fear of the unknown. No doubt there are scientific discussions to be had about the problems of global warming, nuclear war and engineered viruses. But science starts with what is known, and works outwards from there. Precaution works in the opposite direction: it starts from the unknown, where, by definition, science is helpless.

In the traditional conception, a particular event A caused a particular event B, and by this it was implied that, given any event B, some earlier event A could be discovered which had a relation to it, such that -<\/p><p>(1) Whenever A occurred, it was followed by B;<\/p><p>(2) In this sequence, there was something 'necessary', not a mere de facto occurrence of A first and then B.<\/p><p>The traditional form of causation has not so far been found in nature. Everything in nature is apparently in a state of continuous change, so that what we call one 'event' turns out to be really a process. If this event is to cause another event, the two will have to be contiguous in time; for if there is any interval between them, something may happen during that interval to prevent the expected effect. Cause and effect, therefore, will have to be temporally contiguous processes. It is difficult to believe, at any rate where physical laws are concerned, that the earlier part of the process which is the cause can make any difference to the effect, so long as the later part of the process which is the cause remains unchanged. If we are to take the cause as one event and the effect as another, both must be shortened indefinitely. The result is that we merely have, as the embodiment of our causal law, a certain direction of change at each moment. Hence, we are brought to differential equations as embodying causal laws. A physical law does not say 'A will be followed by B', but tells us what acceleration a particle will have under given circumstances.<\/p><p>Science starts, from generalizations of the form, 'A is usually followed by B'. This is the nearest approach that can be made to a causal law of the traditional sort. It may happen in any particular instance that A is always followed by B, but we cannot know this, since we cannot foresee all the perfectly possible circumstances that might make the sequence fail, or know that none of them will actually occur. If, however, we know of a very large number of cases in which A is followed by B, and few or none in which the sequence fails, we shall in practice be justified in saying 'A causes B', provided we do not attach to the notion of cause any of the metaphysical superstitions that have gathered about the word.<\/p><p>There is another point. It is generally assumed that, given any event, there is someone phenomenon, which is the cause of the event, in question. This seems to be a mere mistake. Cause, in the only sense in which it can be practically applied, means 'nearly invariable antecedent'. We cannot in practice obtain an antecedent which is quite invariable, for this would require us to take account of the whole universe since something not taken account of may prevent the expected effect.
