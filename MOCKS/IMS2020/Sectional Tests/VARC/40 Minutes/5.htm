Air, water and land appear to us as separate spheres, which change over very different scales of time. Weather varies daily; oceans change over millennia; rocks cycle over millions of years; supercontinents take hundreds of millions of years to assemble and break apart. Yet every Earth system affects every other in ways both obvious and hidden from view.\r<br \/>\r<br \/>A house serves as a useful, if imperfect, metaphor for our home planet. When you are considering buying a house, you want to know many things \u2013 when it was built, for example, as well as the age and geometry of its various additions and renovations. You want details about your house\u2019s building materials and their installation. You need to learn about the plumbing system and its source of water, as well as the air handling system \u2013 the furnace and air conditioner and their sources of energy. The smart home buyer also asks about potential risks. Geologists, likewise, study Earth\u2019s origins and major transitions, the nature of rocks and minerals, the movement of water and air, the sources of energy, and the risk from geological hazards.\r<br \/>\r<br \/>A house also mimics some of Earth\u2019s complex behaviours, as different systems are interconnected in sometimes surprising and unexpected ways through negative and positive feedback loops. On a cold winter day, as the temperature inside the house drops below your comfort level, the thermostat responds by turning on the furnace, and the temperature rises. Once the house warms up, the furnace shuts off. On hot summer days, the air conditioner mirrors that response by tripping on if the inside temperature rises too high. Earth, too, operates through many similar negative feedback loops that help the planet maintain its more or less steady conditions of temperature, humidity and composition at and near the surface. So, for example, warming oceans result in more clouds, which reflect sunlight back into space and cool the oceans. Likewise, rising concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide cause global warming, which accelerates rock weathering \u2013 a process that gradually consumes excess carbon dioxide and leads in turn to cooling.\r<br \/>\r<br \/>Houses also occasionally display reinforcing or \u2018positive\u2019 feedback, sometimes with bad consequences. If your heating system fails on a cold winter day, the pipes can freeze and burst, causing cold water to flood your home, making the house even colder and less liveable. Many of the uncertainties regarding Earth\u2019s changing climate today focus on potential positive feedback loops and their tipping points. Rising sea levels will lead to coastal flooding, which might result in more evaporation and rainfall, which causes&nbsp;more coastal flooding. A warming ocean might cause the widespread melting of methane-rich ice at and beneath the ocean floor, which could add the greenhouse gas methane to the atmosphere and cause even more warming, which could release even more methane. We have only to look at the runaway greenhouse effect of our sister planet Venus, with its thick carbon dioxide atmosphere and 460-degree Celsius surface temperatures, to see the potentially catastrophic effects of unchecked positive feedback.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<p>While this passage does feature an extended metaphor comparing the Earth to a house, the purpose of the metaphor is not to highlight the similarity between the two\u00a0<em>per se<\/em>, but rather, to illustrate the principles underlying Earth\u2019s systems and their interconnectedness.

Choose the most appropriate answer to each question.<\/strong><\/span>\u00a0<\/p><p><br \/>The German physicist Werner Heisenberg allegedly said: \u2018When I meet God, I am going to ask him two questions: Why relativity?\u00a0And why turbulence? I really believe he will have an answer for the first.\u2019 The quote is apparently apocryphal, although not implausible. But, like most such stories, it was coined to make a point: understanding turbulent fluid flow is so hard that neither Heisenberg nor, perhaps, God could achieve it.\u00a0<br \/><br \/>Whether it is genuine or not, Heisenberg\u2019s remark is illuminating, because it illustrates different ways in which a scientific problem can be perplexing. One is that the phenomena themselves lie outside our mundane experience. The theory of relativity developed by Albert Einstein might, at least from the perspective of the 1930s, be deemed a piece of deistic obfuscation because it is well hidden in our everyday world and therefore seems rather superfluous. It is not immediately clear why any deity would feel the need to build a universe governed by anything other than the old Newtonian laws of mechanics. Why dictate that these must give way to strange relativistic effects such as the shrinking of space and the stretching of time when objects move very fast? The maths needed to comprehend relativity is hard, but not burdensomely so by the standards of theoretical physics. Yet the concepts involved defy our experience and intuitions.\u00a0<br \/><br \/>Other problems in science may be difficult because they really do demand a degree of mathematical abstraction and sophistication that is not accessible to most of us. Superstring theory is somewhat like this: most of us can see that a lifetime would not be enough to decode its equations.\u00a0<br \/><br \/>But turbulence is difficult and perplexing in yet another way. The basic question is simple: how do we describe a fast-flowing fluid in mathematical terms? When flow is vigorous enough, the regular structures and patterns in fluid tend to dissolve, leaving an apparent chaos\u00a0that changes with every passing moment. And yet this does <em>not<\/em> destroy all structure, for then the liquid would be pervaded by random motion throughout, so that on average the flow is merely uniform. We <em>do<\/em> see patterns in turbulent flow, for example, as can be seen in\u00a0the eddies of rivers. Swirling vortices are continuously born and swallowed up, offering tantalizing hints of order. But how do we capture and describe that order?\u00a0<br \/><br \/>It is not that we don\u2019t know how to build a theory \u2013 the principles governing the flow are actually remarkably straightforward. We simply apply Newton\u2019s laws of motion throughout the fluid, which describe how the fluid\u2019s velocity changes in proportion to the forces that act on it. The problem is that we can\u2019t solve these equations. They are too complicated, because the fluid motion is now totally interdependent: the movement of each little \u2018piece\u2019 of fluid depends strongly on that of all the surrounding pieces. In a sense, this is always true in a fluid; but when it becomes turbulent, it is no longer possible to make approximations or to take averages. Every detail matters.\u00a0So the problem is difficult not because we don\u2019t know what the ingredients are, but because those ingredients are too mixed up to make sense of them. There is just too much going on.\u00a0<br \/><br \/>Many of the greatest scientists have bloodied their knuckles against the implacable walls that surround the problem of turbulent fluid flow.

This simple and readily tested observation, first published by Galileo, refuted Aristotle, who claimed that heavy things fall faster. As Galileo put it, \u2018I greatly doubt that Aristotle ever tested by experiment whether it be true.\u2019 We are left to wonder how people could have believed what they were told, and for two millennia at that, without ever checking? Surely the power of evidence over authority is obvious.<br \/><br \/>Except it isn\u2019t. Even today, evidence has barely begun to upend authority; the world is still more in thrall to Aristotle than Galileo. As a simple example, the time-honoured advice for those suffering from bad backs has been bed rest. Only recently, though, have we discovered bed rest isn\u2019t the best treatment, and isn\u2019t even particularly good compared to moderate activity. How did this discovery come about? A researcher in the field of Evidence-based Medicine surveyed multiple databases of trials and results for patients with back pain.
