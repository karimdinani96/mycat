For pop music, the beginning of radio broadcast technology stimulated a thirst for new sounds and new voices that proliferated vigorously across the world. The explosion of popular songwriting, from the 1920s to the present, is a glorious, life-affirming phenomenon. The 'popular age', as it rapidly became known, brought undreamed-of musical benefits and rewards to humankind. But pop's success also provoked a concern that it had wittingly or unwittingly brought about the near extinction of other, older forms of music \u2013 an accusation specifically levelled at jazz. It did not help that 'non-popular' music was generically becoming known as 'classical' music, a term that began circulating in the 1930s as a marketing distinction used by record companies hoping to target listeners through the genres they preferred. But by the 1960s it had come to mean, for many millions, simply 'old-fashioned'.<\/span><\/p>","ItemPassageID":0,"PassageItemIndex":0,"Passage":null,"PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The paragraph is about the contrast between 'popular' (pop) music and 'classical' music in the twentieth century due to new technologies such as radio and records.

Choose the most appropriate answer to each question.<\/strong><\/span><\/p><p><br \/>On 11 June 1144, twenty archbishops and bishops gathered in the abbey church of St Denis, in Paris. Most of the bishops, who had not visited St Denis before, were astonished by what they saw. It is no exaggeration to say that Abbot\u00a0Suger, the man in charge of the church, had created there the first completely new architectural style in 1,700 years. It was an aesthetic and intellectual breakthrough of the first order.<br \/><br \/>Traditionally, ecclesiastical buildings had been erected in the Romanesque style, an elaboration of eastern Mediterranean basilicas, essentially enclosed structures designed for use in hot countries, and which had originated using primitive materials.\u00a0Suger\u2019s new St Denis was quite different. He used the new architectural understanding, which combined the latest mathematics, to create a vast edifice, where the horizontal emphasis of Romanesque churches was replaced by perpendicular planes and ribbed vaulting, where\u00a0\u2018flying buttresses\u2019, on the\u00a0<em>outside <\/em>of the buildings, supported the walls, enabling the immense nave to be largely free of pillars, and where huge perpendicular windows allowed in great swathes of light to illuminate the hitherto murky interior and to shine upon the altar. Not the least impressive feature of the cathedral was the stained-glass rose window over the main entrance. The iridescent\u00a0colours and the intricate lace-like pattern of the stone-work were as breathtaking as the ingenuity shown by the craftsmen in using the glass to display biblical narratives in this new art form.<br \/><br \/>In addition to the general concept of light,\u00a0Suger introduced several new features. The two crenellated towers set in the fa\u00e7ade were meant to give the cathedral a military feel, a symbol of\u00a0militant Christianity and the king\u2019s role in defending the faith. The portal was triple, reflecting the doctrine of the Trinity. The rose window lighted three high chapels,\u00a0\u2018dedicated to the celestial hierarchies\u2019 the Virgin, St Michael and the angels. At the far end of the choir there was a semicircular sequence of chapels (the apse), which both enabled many monks\/priests to say mass at the same time and endowed the choir with a glow of light which complemented that from the rose window. And, with the supporting buttresses now outside the church, there was room for an ambulatory, around the nave, from which side chapels, again lit by daylight, led off. These too enabled more and more monks\/priests to say mass. But above all, the whole church was now open \u2013 especially as\u00a0Suger removed the rood screen all of it bathed in one light, so as to make the entire structure a single mystical entity. All of these light-related entities were designed to help the faithful gathered together as one enormous congregation approach God.<br \/><br \/>Suger was more successful than perhaps even he anticipated. Between 1155 and 1180 cathedrals were built at\u00a0Noyon,\u00a0Laon, Soissons and\u00a0Senlis. The rose window at St Denis inspired similar structures at Chartres, Bourges and Angers.
