Besides the rural allowance, since 2002 China's fifty-six ethnic minorities \u2013 anyone other than the 92 percent Han majority \u2013 have been permitted three, lest they shrink into cultural extinction. Exemptions were also granted for miners (because of high mortality), for the disabled, and for children born abroad.<br \/> <br \/>In recent years, only children who marry each other may now also have two, although most couples willingly stop at one: the cost of kids gets daunting if two onlies also are expected to help support four retired parents and up to eight grandparents. With China building more and bigger cities than the Earth has ever seen, and filling them as soon as the concrete dries, the newly urban occupants no longer need sons for farmhands. Instead, they need factory salaries to raise the one allotted to them. Only the luckiest who, through some entrepreneurial stroke, propel themselves up the upwardly mobile spiral, even think of more children.<br \/> <br \/>Although bereft of siblings, Lin Xia also benefited from the one-child policy. Before, when sons had preference, just one-fourth of university students were female. Today, it's nearly half. After studying mechanical engineering and communications, she works as a science writer. Her magazine's office is in one of the dozens of skyscrapers built in the pre-2008 Olympics frenzy in Chaoyang, a bleak industrial warren that metamorphosed into Beijing's gleaming Central Business District. It's exciting to live in this incredible city and bigger-than-anything country.<br \/> <br \/>But how big can China actually get?<br \/> <br \/>There are now at least a hundred and fifty Chinese cities with more than a million people; by 2025, there will be two hundred and twenty. During the first quarter of this century, half the world's new buildings will be built in China. With half the Chinese now living in cities \u2013\u00a0compared to one-fifth in 1980 \u2013 and three-fourths expected to be urban by 2030, the construction will only increase. Although China's fertility rate dipped to replacement within a decade of the one-child policy's enactment, sheer momentum means that its population will keep growing for another generation. In 2012, China was adding another million people about every seven weeks.<br \/> <br \/>'I can't imagine 400 million more Chinese,' Xia says \u2013 that being the difference the one-child policy is widely believed to have made. She recalls a slogan from the Chinese National Population and Family Planning Commission: 'Mother Earth is too tired to sustain more children.' She once heard a prominent Chinese demographer remark that 700 million would be the right population for China \u2013 just over half the current 1.3 billion. Seven hundred million was China's population in 1964. Just a half-century ago.<\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":false,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> This passage focuses on current and near-future problems in China due to overpopulation.

This is acceptable for a creature living in surroundings that are constant and predictable. However, in a rapidly changing environment, where a quick response to threats is essential for survival, a faster method of internal communication is imperative. Such a means is provided by electricity. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Remarkably, electricity is as ancient a feature of cells as chemical messengers. Cellular membranes are leaky and prone to let through dangerous charged atoms such as the sodium in salt. In order to survive, bacteria needed a way to pump out such ions. They solved the problem with the aid of tunnel-like proteins called ion channels, which span the cell membrane and can open and shut to expel ions. But, inevitably, pumping ions through such a channel creates an imbalance of electric charge between the inside and the outside of the cell. It is this voltage difference that provides a cell with a nifty communication opportunity.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">To send a super-fast signal, a cell needs only to manipulate the voltage across its membrane, which it can do simply by pumping ions rapidly through an ion channel. This causes an abrupt change in the voltage across the membrane, which has a knock-on effect on the next ion channel, and the next, and so on. Like a microscopic Mexican wave, an electrical signal propagates along the membrane, thousands of times faster than any chemical messenger, <em>literally at lightning speed<\/em>. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Of course, a communication system based on electricity \u2013 a true <em>cellular telephone system<\/em>\u00a0\u2013 needs a means not only of transmitting a signal but a means of detecting it at its destination and doing something useful with it. Cells have this covered too. A type of channel known as a voltage-gated ion channel can open in response to an electrical signal, allowing ions such as calcium to pass through the membrane. These then trigger a cascade of cellular processes, effectively turning the incoming electrical signal back into a bog-standard chemical messenger, which can do something useful such as trigger the building of a protein. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">An internal cellular telephone system was in existence even before the first multicellular animals. But what was a useful trick for a single-celled creature turns out to be indispensable for a multicellular organism. After all, as creatures grew ever larger, it became likely that the place on their bodies where they sensed a dangerous touch was a <em>long way<\/em> from the place where a muscle had to be contracted in response. Sending a signal via a chemical messenger was far too slow. Long before an animal could take evasive action, it might be eaten. Electricity was the only solution.

Even the vast amounts spent by America's 'star-wars' programme failed to produce lasers which could act as agents of destruction in their own right. But that money did help the development of a laser technology with a promising future as a research tool, if not as a weapon: the free-electron laser (FEL). As a way of trying out new laser applications it is in a class of its own. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\" lang=\"EN-US\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\" lang=\"EN-US\">The FEL's charm comes from its tunability. The beam of light at a single wavelength which is the hallmark of a laser is produced by getting lots of electrons to lose the same amount of energy at the same time: the greater the amount of energy they lose, the shorter the wavelength. In normal lasers, the electrons are bound to atoms; they lose energy by falling from a higher energy level to a lower one. Because the levels are fixed, these electrons can give off energy only in certain quantities, which means that lasers can work only at certain wavelengths.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\" lang=\"EN-US\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\" lang=\"EN-US\">In an FEL, the electrons move freely in a beam; magnets wiggle them around, which makes them lose energy. The exact amount of energy lost can be controlled by moving the magnets and changing the energy the electrons start off with. That means the wavelength of the radiation given off in the FEL \u2013 normally infrared light \u2013 can be varied by factors of ten or more. This allows researchers to explore a whole range of effects specific to different wavelengths.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\" lang=\"EN-US\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\" lang=\"EN-US\">A team of medics and physicists from Vanderbilt University has put this tunability to use developing a new way of blasting away bits of surplus tissue. In the past, people trying to ablate tissue with infrared lasers used short bursts at a wavelength of 3 microns (three-thousandths of a millimetre). This wavelength heats up water by encouraging the hydrogen and oxygen in it to vibrate; the water in the sample turns to steam, causing a little explosion. It is not a bad way of wearing down the surface of a nerve, or an eye, but it has its disadvantages. The heat and the explosion damage the surrounding tissue; it is as if a tiny bomb had gone off. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\" lang=\"EN-US\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\" lang=\"EN-US\">The Vanderbilt team tried another wavelength.

This statement:<\/span><\/p>","ItemPassageID":6785,"PassageItemIndex":0,"Passage":"<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> For seeking things out, lasers are fine military tools, allowing precision targeting which minimizes collateral damage; the actual harm, though, is left to the bomb that follows the laser's guidance. Even the vast amounts spent by America's 'star-wars' programme failed to produce lasers which could act as agents of destruction in their own right. But that money did help the development of a laser technology with a promising future as a research tool, if not as a weapon: the free-electron laser (FEL). As a way of trying out new laser applications it is in a class of its own. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\" lang=\"EN-US\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\" lang=\"EN-US\">The FEL's charm comes from its tunability. The beam of light at a single wavelength which is the hallmark of a laser is produced by getting lots of electrons to lose the same amount of energy at the same time: the greater the amount of energy they lose, the shorter the wavelength. In normal lasers, the electrons are bound to atoms; they lose energy by falling from a higher energy level to a lower one. Because the levels are fixed, these electrons can give off energy only in certain quantities, which means that lasers can work only at certain wavelengths.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\" lang=\"EN-US\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\" lang=\"EN-US\">In an FEL, the electrons move freely in a beam; magnets wiggle them around, which makes them lose energy. The exact amount of energy lost can be controlled by moving the magnets and changing the energy the electrons start off with. That means the wavelength of the radiation given off in the FEL \u2013 normally infrared light \u2013 can be varied by factors of ten or more. This allows researchers to explore a whole range of effects specific to different wavelengths.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\" lang=\"EN-US\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\" lang=\"EN-US\">A team of medics and physicists from Vanderbilt University has put this tunability to use developing a new way of blasting away bits of surplus tissue. In the past, people trying to ablate tissue with infrared lasers used short bursts at a wavelength of 3 microns (three-thousandths of a millimetre). This wavelength heats up water by encouraging the hydrogen and oxygen in it to vibrate; the water in the sample turns to steam, causing a little explosion. It is not a bad way of wearing down the surface of a nerve, or an eye, but it has its disadvantages. The heat and the explosion damage the surrounding tissue; it is as if a tiny bomb had gone off. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\" lang=\"EN-US\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\" lang=\"EN-US\">The Vanderbilt team tried another wavelength. At around 6.4 microns, infrared light encourages a whole lot of shaking to go on among the amino acids that make up proteins; energy at that wavelength in effect melts the protein. At a similar wavelength, water molecules also absorb radiation \u2013 though not by the same route as at 3 microns \u2013 and thus warm up. By melting the protein in the target at the same time as it vaporizes the water, the laser causes a gentler explosion; it is as if the casing of a bomb dissolved as it went off, thus leaving no shrapnel.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\" lang=\"EN-US\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\" lang=\"EN-US\">Using this technique, the team has etched designs on brain tissue with no trace of damage to any of the surroundings. As on the battlefield, the collateral damage is minimized. This could be quite helpful for precision neurosurgery. The eventual surgeon's tool will probably not be an FEL; the accelerator for an electron beam, the magnets and the tuning controls make them unwieldy multi-million-dollar machines. Now that a good wavelength has been found, a cheaper conventional laser can be built to reproduce it. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\" lang=\"EN-US\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">By showing which wavelengths are useful and which are not, FELs could help doctors acquire lasers suited to their tasks, rather than the not-particularly-useful versions of lasers developed for other purposes which some make do with now. The next wavelength in the Vanderbilt team's sights is one that targets amino acids but not water, thus melting proteins non-explosively. That might be useful for surgery within the eye. Ranging free along the spectrum, the FEL could designate any number of targets for medical science before it is done.<\/span><\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":false,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> Throughout the passage, the author uses terms such as 'explosion', 'shrapnel' and 'collateral damage' associated with bombs to describe the effects of medical lasers, as well as direct comparisons: 'it is as if a tiny bomb had gone off'; 'it is as if the casing of a bomb dissolved as it went off, thus leaving no shrapnel'; 'As on the battlefield, the collateral damage is minimized'.

As soon as a historian recorded the history of the past, someone could go back into the past and rewrite it. Not only would time machines put historians out of business, but they would enable us to alter the course of time at will. If, for example, we were to go back to the era of the dinosaurs and accidentally step on a mammal that happens to be our ancestor, perhaps we would accidentally wipe out the entire human race. History would become an unending, madcap\u00a0<em>Monty Python<\/em>\u00a0episode, as tourists from the future trampled over historic events while trying to get the best camera angle.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>Time travel poses all sorts of problems, both technical as well as social. The moral, legal and ethical issues are raised by Larry Dwyer, who notes, 'Should a time traveller who punches his younger self (or vice versa) be charged with assault? Should the time traveller who murders someone and then flees into the past for sanctuary be tried in the past for crimes he committed in the future? If he marries in the past can he be tried for bigamy even though his other wife will not be born for almost 5,000 years?'<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>But perhaps the thorniest problems are the logical paradoxes raised by time travel. For example, what happens if we kill our parents before we are born? This is a logical impossibility. It is sometimes called the 'grandfather paradox'.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>There are three ways to resolve these paradoxes. First, perhaps you simply repeat past history when you go back in time, therefore fulfilling the past. In this case, you have no free will. You are forced to complete the past as it was written. Thus, if you go back into the past to give the secret of time travel to your younger self, then it was meant to happen that way. The secret of time travel came from the future. It was destiny. (But this does not tell us where the original idea came from.)<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>Second, you have free will, so you can change the past, but within limits. Your free will is not allowed to create a time paradox. Whenever you try to kill your parents before you are born, a mysterious force prevents you from pulling the trigger. This position has been advocated by the Russian physicist Igor Novikov. (He argues that there is a law preventing us from walking on the ceiling, although we might want to. Hence there might be a law preventing us from killing our parents before we are born. Some strange law prevents us from pulling the trigger.)<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>Third, the universe splits into two universes. This possibility seems to be the one consistent with the quantum theory and the idea of the multiverse. The idea is that when you try to go into the past, the time line of our universe branches off, creating a parallel universe. Thus, whenever we go back into the river of time, the river forks into two rivers, and one time line becomes two time lines, or what is called the 'many worlds' approach.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>This means that all time travel paradoxes can be solved. If you have killed your parents before you were born, it simply means you have killed some people who are genetically identical to your parents, with the same memories and personalities, but they are not your true parents.<\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":false,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<p><span>In discussing the resolution of time paradoxes, the author brings up ideas from physics \u2013 for example, the Russian physicist Igor Novikov's idea in paragraph 5, or the parallel universe idea in paragraph 6. So it is possible that he might be a physicist. It is quite likely that he may be a science fiction writer, exploring aspects of time travel to be used in his books. He could be a philosopher, exploring the moral, legal, ethical and logical dilemmas raised by the concept of time travel. But while the author mentions the negative effect that time travel would have on history, he does not discuss any actual history. So it is not very likely that he is a historian.
