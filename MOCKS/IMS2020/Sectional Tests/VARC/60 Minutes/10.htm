While the second law of thermodynamics is an important concept in this passage, the passage as a whole is not about it, but rather about Maxwell's efforts to find a loophole in it. Thus, [4] can be eliminated. Maxwell does wrestle with the problem of free will \u2013 which he resolves by introducing the concept of 'Maxwell's demon' which has the power to bypass the second law of thermodynamics.

When you are considering buying a house, you want to know many things \u2013 when it was built, for example, as well as the age and geometry of its various additions and renovations. You want details about your house\u2019s building materials and their installation. You need to learn about the plumbing system and its source of water, as well as the air handling system \u2013 the furnace and air conditioner and their sources of energy. The smart home buyer also asks about potential risks. Geologists, likewise, study Earth\u2019s origins and major transitions, the nature of rocks and minerals, the movement of water and air, the sources of energy, and the risk from geological hazards.\r<br \/>\r<br \/>A house also mimics some of Earth\u2019s complex behaviours, as different systems are interconnected in sometimes surprising and unexpected ways through negative and positive feedback loops. On a cold winter day, as the temperature inside the house drops below your comfort level, the thermostat responds by turning on the furnace, and the temperature rises. Once the house warms up, the furnace shuts off. On hot summer days, the air conditioner mirrors that response by tripping on if the inside temperature rises too high. Earth, too, operates through many similar negative feedback loops that help the planet maintain its more or less steady conditions of temperature, humidity and composition at and near the surface. So, for example, warming oceans result in more clouds, which reflect sunlight back into space and cool the oceans. Likewise, rising concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide cause global warming, which accelerates rock weathering \u2013 a process that gradually consumes excess carbon dioxide and leads in turn to cooling.\r<br \/>\r<br \/>Houses also occasionally display reinforcing or \u2018positive\u2019 feedback, sometimes with bad consequences. If your heating system fails on a cold winter day, the pipes can freeze and burst, causing cold water to flood your home, making the house even colder and less liveable. Many of the uncertainties regarding Earth\u2019s changing climate today focus on potential positive feedback loops and their tipping points. Rising sea levels will lead to coastal flooding, which might result in more evaporation and rainfall, which causes&nbsp;more coastal flooding. A warming ocean might cause the widespread melting of methane-rich ice at and beneath the ocean floor, which could add the greenhouse gas methane to the atmosphere and cause even more warming, which could release even more methane.

If your heating system fails on a cold winter day, the pipes can freeze and burst, causing cold water to flood your home, making the house even colder and less liveable. Many of the uncertainties regarding Earth\u2019s changing climate today focus on potential positive feedback loops and their tipping points. Rising sea levels will lead to coastal flooding, which might result in more evaporation and rainfall, which causes&nbsp;more coastal flooding. A warming ocean might cause the widespread melting of methane-rich ice at and beneath the ocean floor, which could add the greenhouse gas methane to the atmosphere and cause even more warming, which could release even more methane.

Choose the most appropriate answer to each question.<\/strong><\/span><br \/><br \/>Microeconomics studies how millions of consumers choose what goods and services to buy, how producers make decisions to meet these demands, and how the two sides interact. Much of the time the transactions work fairly smoothly. That is why microeconomics is often a story of the dog that does not bark in the night, which in turn explains why non-economists are often unaware of any microeconomic problems. But from time to time things do go wrong \u2013 for example, the gasoline shortages in the 1970s and the housing bubble and its collapse in the 2000s. Therefore it behoves all intelligent people to get some basic understanding of microeconomics: when and how transactions go well, when and why they fail, and what can be done when they do fail or threaten to fail.<br \/><br \/>In most societies, consumers and producers interact in markets \u2013 not necessarily traditional bazaars and marketplaces, but shops, restaurants, other venues like bargaining tables and auctions, and increasingly the Internet. In a market, buyers pay a price to sellers for the good or service. This price serves a twofold purpose. First, if something is scarce, its price rises; thus a high price conveys <em>information<\/em> about scarcity. Second, when a price is high, a supplier of that good or service can profit by producing more of it, and buyers will buy less or switch to something else; thus a high price also provides a natural <em>incentive<\/em> for actions that alleviate the scarcity. Information and incentive mechanisms to coordinate transactions between producers and consumers, and specifically whether and how prices work in this dual capacity, are the main subject matter of microeconomics.<br \/><br \/>The focus on information and incentives also tells us when and why the price mechanism can fail: it may convey inadequate or wrong information or incentives, or responses to these signals may not occur. The most frequent failure of this kind arises when one person\u2019s actions have spillover effects on others. Every car driver contributes to air pollution, which increases the scarcity of clean air. But there is no market or price for clean air, so no one gets a signal of that scarcity and no one has a profit incentive to alleviate it.<br \/><br \/>The price mechanism can also fail if responses to its signals are suppressed. Price controls suppress them. So do barriers to entry of new producers: whether natural barriers, strategic ones erected by entrenched producers, or those created by government policies. Further, existing producers can conspire to preserve some scarcity so as to drive up the price for their own greater profit. In socialist countries where production and supply are in the hands of the state, its functionaries have little to gain personally by satisfying consumers and suffer few penalties by neglecting them. Without markets the functionaries even lack good information about scarcity. That is why those systems have chronic shortages and poor quality.<br \/><br \/>A different kind of market failure arises from a moral or ethical perspective. The signals and incentives of the price mechanism are ineffective if would-be buyers don\u2019t have the purchasing power to back up their desire. In the \u2018Simple Simon\u2019 nursery rhyme, the Pieman said to Simple Simon: \u2018Show me first your penny,\u2019 and Simon had to reply: \u2018Indeed I have not any\u2019. This is a trivial example, but we may legitimately regard some wants such as health and education as meritorious or basic human rights, regardless of a person\u2019s private ability to pay for them. Deciding and implementing policies to fulfil such wants become an issue in political economy.<\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":false,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<p><span style=\"color: #auto;\">Refer to paragraph 3, in which the author discusses the problem of air pollution in terms of microeconomics, citing the problem as the fact that \u2018there is no market or price for clean air\u2019. So this scenario cannot be said to be beyond the scope of microeconomics. [2] does not make sense \u2013 a fine would motivate drivers to pollute less, which would make clean air more abundant not scarcer. It cannot be inferred on the basis of this passage how a small or large fine would affect pollution, so [3] can be ruled out. But it can be inferred that the fine would effectively be a price on clean air, which would then be subject to microeconomic principles, such that an increase in the price of clean air (i.e. the imposition of the fine) would provide an incentive for people to alleviate the scarcity of clean air (i.e. by polluting less).
