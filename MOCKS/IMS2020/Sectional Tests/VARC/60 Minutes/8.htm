The study of architecture was the study of ornament. Debates regarding ornament centred on the manner in which ornament was to be deployed. In 1828, for example, German architect Heinrich H\u00fcbsch saw style as the 'essence' of art and architecture and posed the question, 'In what style should we build?' While his contemporaries argued the virtues or shortcomings of various styles - Moorish vs. Romanesque, Greek Corinthian vs. Roman Corinthian - H\u00fcbsch sought a new style. He believed that each country or region might develop its own contemporary style, rather than mimic the styles of the past. The debate over what style was most appropriate grew more impatient as the 19th century came to a close and took a radical turn at the dawn of the 20th century.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>With the emergence of the technologic, economic and scientific mindset of the late 1800s, ornament itself was called into question.

Since the 1970s, the Indian film industry generally has outgrown its American counterpart by some distance. Of course, not all of its films are musicals, far from it; but the musical is hugely popular in India, and many films that in other cultures would be about as far from musicals as anything could be, turn effectively to song or dance at some point. Mani Rathnam\u2019s <em>Bombay<\/em> (1995), for example, which has been compared to Steven Spielberg\u2019s <em>Schindler\u2019s List<\/em> (1993), is an eloquent case.

Choose the most appropriate answer to each question.<\/strong><\/span><br \/><br \/>The American musical has had some striking successes since the 1950s, but the real home of the genre is now on another continent. Since the 1970s, the Indian film industry generally has outgrown its American counterpart by some distance. Of course, not all of its films are musicals, far from it; but the musical is hugely popular in India, and many films that in other cultures would be about as far from musicals as anything could be, turn effectively to song or dance at some point. Mani Rathnam\u2019s <em>Bombay<\/em> (1995), for example, which has been compared to Steven Spielberg\u2019s <em>Schindler\u2019s List<\/em> (1993), is an eloquent case. While the very idea of singing in the Spielberg movie would seem to shift it into the territory of farce, nothing of the kind happens in the Indian film, where a melancholy romance forms a memorable response to a historical nightmare.<br \/><br \/>Visually, Indian musicals owe a great deal to Hollywood, and often look as if they borrowed their colours from MGM and their high-angle camera shots from Busby Berkeley. But of course, they have a very long indigenous tradition of dance and myth behind them, and the combinations of East and West on the screen are often remarkable, leaving you shaking your head at the elegant, rapid crossovers, the \u2018modern\u2019 movement of this ancient dance form, the \u2018ancient\u2019 accent of this thoroughly modern chorus. There has been a reciprocal influence, and the Hollywood filmmaker BazLuhrmann has acknowledged the influence of the Indian industry on his own brightly coloured musical <em>Moulin Rouge<\/em> (2001).<br \/><br \/>So what about the stretch across the genre? Does it undo the genre as such? It undoes easy generalizations, and there are no thematic preoccupations that carry across musicals as they do across westerns. But the twinning of music and ordinary life, or the simulation of ordinary life, beautifully represented by the song and dance number at the end of <em>Slumdog Millionaire<\/em> (2008), not in itself a musical, is surely a metaphor or a promise of considerable power. The bright colours and the noise become decor and disco. The railway station, once the location of panic and poverty and violence, becomes scenery. The beat is heavy and fast, the hero and heroine line up together, happily stomping in the front row of a vast dancing crowd. Even the trains look as if they want to get in on the act.<br \/><br \/>Whether the figure who shifts from talking to singing or from walking to dancing is Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly or Doris Day or Catherine Deneuve or Freida Pinto, a sense of life\u2019s lyrical capacities is asserted. The great musicals, we might say, are the ones where such singing and dancing feel, if not natural, at least vividly called for; and the lesser works are the ones where the music just interrupts the action, or the action plods along until the music returns.<\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":false,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<p>There is no basis for inferring [1] from the passage; if anything, the author seems to feel the opposite when it comes to great musicals (see the example of\u00a0<em><span style=\"color: #auto;\">Bombay<\/span><\/em><span style=\"color: #auto;\"> or the author\u2019s statement in the last paragraph).

In its broadest sense, the moniker \u2018amateur\u2019 was also often used in a disparaging manner, denoting someone who dabbled in an activity or undertook it in a superficial way. But in the sporting world the term had a much more robust meaning, and certainly did not dismiss the amateur as a dabbler. In 1882, for\u00a0example, the sporting newspaper,\u00a0<em>The Field<\/em>, in a debate over the pay for play issue warned that players should either keep \u2018within the bounds of honest amateurism, or turn professional\u2019.

The core values of sporting amateurism, its codes, can be summed up as: leisure, loyalty and decency pursued by gentlemen. As Richard Holt surmised, \u2018Sport was not just about winning and losing: it was a moral and aesthetic endeavour.

In many popular urban sports, such as pedestrianism or foot racing, tracks were built alongside public houses, and entrance fees charged for spectators to watch the contests. Much mid-19<span><sup>th<\/sup><\/span> century sport was commercial, and it was against such commercialism, with its attendant drinking and gambling, that the amateur lobby would mount their campaign of sporting purity.<br \/><br \/>The most telling example of the clash between the views of amateurs and the professionals, who were a product of the commercialization of sport, happened in the game of rugby. The sport developed at Rugby School in the 1840s, and proved popular in other elite schools and colleges. It had spread beyond its initial demographic of the social elite, and had found a popular following in the industrial towns of the north of England amongst the sport hungry workers. The governing body of the game, the Rugby Football Union (RFU), was dominated by the southern, socially elite followers of the game who had an unswerving commitment to amateurism. However, despite the commercialization of the game in terms of paying crowds, the amateur rules of the RFU forbade any player being paid for missing work so that they could play. This resulted in a split in rugby, with professionals breaking away from rugby union authorities which would not countenance the idea of paid players, and forming their own league.\u00a0<br \/><br \/>This split in rugby over pay for play was a microcosm of the larger issues between amateurs and professionals. The former didn\u2019t simply oppose the idea of payment for players, but argued that the accompanying commercialization of sport and the shift in player motivation and ethos altered the very moral grounds on which sport was played. It was also simple snobbery, and a desire amongst the social\u00a0elite to keep their games free of the lower orders. The separate social spheres for the classes were most pronounced in cricket. While the game had allowed for the payment of players very early on, the class distinctions between the amateurs and the professionals were underlined: the former were referred to as \u2018gentlemen\u2019, had separate dressing rooms, and entered the field of play by a separate gate than the latter, who were known as \u2018players\u2019.
