He returns unknowingly to his homeland and becomes a good and noble king, only to be cut down by the machinations of fate. His terrible future is revealed in a prophecy by the old sage Tiresias.

We can see this just by looking at a map. From the mid-1st\u00a0\u00a0millennium B.C. onwards, a band of rather similar empires grew up across the Old World from the Mediterranean to China. All were large, peaceful, stable and prosperous. Across the oceans, smaller but still formidable states also ruled parts of Central America and the Andes.<\/p> <p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0<\/p> <p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0<\/p> <p class=\"body\">At their height, the greatest of these empires \u2013 the Roman in the West, the Han in what we now call China, and the Mauryan in modern India and Pakistan \u2013 each covered about 1.5\u20132 million square miles, governed thirty to sixty million people, and beat (most of) its swords into ploughshares. In each empire, rates of violent death declined sharply, and people put their ploughshares to good use, prospering in a golden age of relative peace and plenty.<\/p> <p class=\"body\">\u00a0<\/p> <p class=\"body\">\u00a0<\/p> <p class=\"body\">On the whole, we know less about the Han and Mauryan Empires than about Rome, and less still about states in the New World. In the Americas, the shortage of evidence is so acute that specialists cannot even agree on the region where powerful states first appeared. Some archaeologists see the Olmec culture in what is now Mexico (ca. 1200 B.C.) and Chav\u00ed\u00adn de Huantar in what is now Peru (ca. 1000 B.C.) as the pioneers. Mainstream opinion, however, holds that it was only a thousand years later, in the age of the Moche culture in Peru and the city-states of Monte Alb\u00e1n and Teotihuac\u00e1n in Mexico, that America's first functioning governments put in an appearance, imposing their will over thousands of square miles and with populations probably running up into a few million. They built great monuments, oversaw elaborate trade networks, and presided over rising standards of living, but remained preliterate.<\/p> <p class=\"body\">\u00a0<\/p> <p class=\"body\">\u00a0<\/p> <p class=\"body\">That is bad news for historians. Even when archaeology reaches the highest standards possible, there are limits to what it can tell us. Perhaps the human sacrifices excavated at Teotihuac\u00e1n show that this was a more violent society than the Old World's ancient empires, but since Romans did flock to watch gladiators hack each other to pieces (plenty of their dismembered bodies have been dug up), perhaps not. The sixty bodies found buried in a royal tomb of the Andean kingdom of Wari around A.D. 800 \u2013 long after Old World empires had given up such practices \u2013 might also point to higher levels of violence in the New World than in the Old, but when we get right down to it, the evidence is just not good enough for systematic comparisons. What we really need is a historian from these New World states who would tell us what was going on.<\/p> <p class=\"body\">\u00a0<\/p> <p class=\"body\">\u00a0<\/p> <p>Yet the fact that we do not have one, and almost certainly never will, is revealing in itself.

The implication is that written records by a historian of the time would have been more useful. So the answer is [2]. [1] is only part of the answer, as the human sacrifices being talked about are specific examples of violence in the ancient New World.

Some designers have appropriated aspects of art practice in their own work, but they remain within the structure of the fashion industry and use these borrowed methods to explore the nature of fashion itself. When, for example, in their early career, designers Viktor and Rolf decided just to stage fashion shows rather than produce any saleable clothes, their designs became one-offs, rare pieces that existed only as comments on the role of the show within the fashion system, rather than wearable garments. However, their work remained within the context of the fashion world, discussed and reviewed by fashion journalists.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>Viktor and Rolf's interpretation of fashion incorporated a fascination with the role of the show, and its potential to test the boundaries of spectacle and display. They slip between art, theatre and film in the staging of their collections. For example, for autumn\/winter 2000, the designers slowly dressed a single model in layer upon layer of garments, until she wore the whole collection. This commented on the process of fitting clothes on the body, which lies at the core of traditional fashion design.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>In Viktor and Rolf's designs and presentations, artistic methods are used to comment on the practice of fashion, but this does not necessarily turn their fashion into art. Their work is shown in the context of the international fashion weeks, it is directed to a fashion audience, and addresses the way clothing and body interact. Even when they were not putting their clothing into production, they followed the fashion seasons, and importantly, they adhered to the fundamental elements of fashion: fabric and body.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>Fashion is sometimes compared to art in order to give it greater validity, depth and purpose. However, this perhaps reveals more about Western concern that fashion lacks these qualities than it does about fashion's actual significance. A Balenciaga dress from the 1950s, when displayed in a pristine glass case in a gallery, may appear like a work of art. However, it does not need to be described as such in order to convey its value or the skill that went into its creation. Like other design forms, such as architecture, fashion has its own particular concerns that prevent it from ever being purely art, craft or industrial design. It is, rather, a three-dimensional design form that incorporates elements of all these approaches. It is Balenciaga's exacting eye for precise form that brings balance and drama to the drape and structure of the fabric, combined with the craft skill of his atelier workers, that turns it into an exceptional piece of fashion clothing. It does not need to be called art in order to validate its status, and this term ignores the reason, beyond his desire to create and test the parameters of fashion design, that Balenciaga's dresses were brought into being: to clothe a woman, and, ultimately, to sell more designs. This should not be seen to diminish his achievement, but to help to understand the way he has worked to exploit these 'limitations' to create fashions that can inspire the viewer as much as the wearer.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>Fashion should be understood on its own terms, and this makes its interactions with other aspects of art and culture more interesting. It opens up the way art, design and commerce connect and overlap in some practitioners' work. Indeed, one of the things that makes fashion so fascinating, and for some, so problematic, is the fact that it continually appropriates, reconfigures and tests the boundaries of these definitions. Thus, fashion can highlight tensions concerning what is valued in a culture. Diverse designers and artists have produced work that played upon cultural contradictions and attitudes. In fashion's case, focus on body and cloth, and the fact that it is, usually, designed to be worn and sold, distinguishes it from fine art. However, this does not prevent fashion from being meaningful, and the art world's continued fascination with fashion underlines its cultural significance.<\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":false,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> The question in [4] is barely answered at all in this passage, apart from the example of Viktor and Rolf's fashion shows.

So it cannot be said that they 'no longer' produce wearable clothes. Thus A is wrong. B is correct, as it is stated in the second sentence of paragraph 2. C is also correct, as it is stated in the first sentence of paragraph 3. The passage does not clarify how Viktor and Rolf see their fashion shows, but the third paragraph suggests that they see them in terms of fashion rather than art. So D is wrong.
