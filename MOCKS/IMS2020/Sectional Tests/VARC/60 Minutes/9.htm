[1] implies that the author does not understand the difference between pulling and pushing doors, which is too extreme. [2] is the author's reaction to the problem in question, not the reason for it.

There seemed to be various kinds of rock types as well: white pebbles of limestone, big sandstone blocks, even pieces of granite and other rocks that had cooled from hot magma. Yet so loosely were they held by the clay that some of them could be plucked out of the cliffs. I took a small piece of some kind of fine-grained igneous rock in my hand and inspected it at close quarters. On it there was something of a polish, but disfigured by a whole series of scratches. But this was obviously a tough rock, so whatever had done the scratching and polishing must have exercised some considerable pressure.<\/p><p class=\"body\">\u00a0<\/p><p class=\"body\">Further along the wadi, the whole valley opened up into a kind of natural amphitheatre, surrounded by steep cliffs evidently composed of the curious, medley rock. But the floor of the amphitheatre was another kind of substance altogether, a hard, solid rock, in complete contrast to the clay-and-boulders, which could now be seen to lie as a great blanket immediately on top of this floor. What was extraordinary was that this hard rock, too, had been polished and gouged, but on a colossal scale. The whole valley floor had been scraped: great grooves scored the surface in a set of lines that ran virtually parallel from one side of the wadi to the other. Some of the grooves deepened in places, as if they had been scraped by the fingernails of some Titan clawing the ground in rage.<\/p><p class=\"body\">\u00a0<\/p><p class=\"body\">The truth is more astounding still. What I was looking at was the evidence of an ice age. Here, where now there beats a sun that melts ice as fast as a hot frying pan melts butter, there had once been rivers of ice: glaciers. Coarse boulders which had been included in these glaciers and carried along like blunt weapons had been responsible for scraping the hard floor of the wadi; finer rock material had produced the polish. Many tonnes of ice had provided the necessary pressure to produce what could now be recognized as a glacial pavement.<\/p><p class=\"body\">\u00a0<\/p><p class=\"body\">And then, when the ice sheet which had once covered the Arabian Peninsula finally melted away, all the material it had formerly carried was dropped. Boulders and stones which may have originated many kilometres away and been carried on the back of the ice were dumped together with the finest of rock that had been ground into flour and mud. The whole together accounted for that odd, plum pudding of a rock formation which lay atop the glacial pavement. If you want to see identical rocks today you must go to Norway or Canada, where permanent ice still lingers. The only possible conclusion was that a great ice age must have scoured the ancient Arabian Peninsula.<\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> The author's conclusion is stated in the last sentence of the passage: 'a great ice age must have scoured the ancient Arabian Peninsula'. The evidence for this is the peculiar rock formations that he found there \u2013\u00a0i.e. the rocks that seem to have been polished and yet have great gouge marks in them, which, according to the author, are indications of glaciers in that region. However, if [1] is true, it would mean that floods, not glaciers, may have created those rock formations. So [1] would weaken the author's conclusion. [2], if true, would strengthen the argument, not weaken it. [3] would neither strengthen nor weaken the argument, as it is not clear whether a wetter climate would indicate an ice age or not. [4] merely suggests that these other places may also have been scoured by glaciers; it does not affect the author's conclusion.

Choose the most appropriate answer to each question.<\/strong><\/span><br \/><br \/>Once upon a time, there was a story. It was told, we suppose, to people crouched around a fire: a tale of adventure, most likely \u2013 relating some close encounter with death; a remarkable hunt, an escape from mortal danger; a vision, or something else out of the ordinary. Whatever its thread, the weaving of this story was done with a prime purpose. The listeners must be kept listening. They must not fall asleep. So, as the story went on, its audience should be sustained by one question above all. What happens next?<br \/><br \/>The first fireside stories in human history can never be known. They were kept in the heads of those who told them. This method of storage is not necessarily inefficient. From documented oral traditions in Australia, the Balkans and other parts of the world we know that specialized storytellers and poets can recite from memory literally thousands of lines, in verse or prose, verbatim \u2013 word for word. But while\u00a0memory is rightly considered an art in itself, it is clear that a primary purpose of making symbols is to have a system of reminders or mnemonic cues \u2013 signs that assist us to recall certain information in the mind\u2019s eye.<br \/><br \/>In some Polynesian communities a notched memory stick may help to guide a storyteller through successive stages of recitation. But in other parts of the world, the activity of storytelling historically resulted in the development or even the invention of writing systems. One theory about the arrival of literacy in ancient Greece, for example, argues that the epic tales about the Trojan War and the wanderings of Odysseus \u2013 traditionally attributed to Homer, a blind Ionian bard of the eighth century BCE \u2013 were just so enchanting to hear that they had to be preserved. So the Greeks, c. 750\u2013700 BCE, borrowed an alphabet from their neighbours in the eastern Mediterranean, the Phoenicians. A full text of Homer\u2019s verse was not established until over a century later; meanwhile, at least snatches of his matchless oral expressions could be inscribed on clay and stone.<br \/><br \/>The custom of recording stories on parchment and other materials can be traced in many manifestations around the world, from the priestly papyrus archives of ancient Egypt to the birch-bark scrolls on which the North American Ojibway Indians set down their creation-myth. It is a well-tried and universal practice: so much so that to this day storytime is probably most often associated with words on paper. The French word for a narrative is\u00a0<em>r\u00e9cit<\/em>, implying some oral delivery (recitation), and our conversations may be full of stories; but the formal practice of narrating a story aloud would seem \u2013 so we assume \u2013 to have given way to newspapers, novels and comic strips. This, however, is not the case. Statistically it is doubtful that the majority of humans currently rely upon the written word to get access to stories. So what is the alternative source?<br \/><br \/>Each year, over 7 billion people across the world will go to watch the latest offering from Hollywood, Bollywood and beyond. This is what prevails: not one voice by cosy firelight, but numerous sounds and images projected on to a big screen. The supreme storyteller of today is cinema.

It\u2019s hard to imagine a modern kitchen\u00a0without pots and therefore hard to appreciate how many dishes we owe to this basic form of equipment. Pots enabled consumption of a far wider range of foods: many plants that had previously been toxic or at least indigestible became edible, once they could be boiled for several hours. Pots mark the leap from mere heating to cuisine: to the calm, considered intermingling of ingredients in a man-made vessel. Historically, the earliest cooking was roasting or barbecuing. Evidence of roasting goes back hundreds of thousands of years. By contrast, clay cooking pots date back only around 9,000 or 10,000 years. Large stone cooking pots from the Tehuaca Valley in Central America have also been found from sometime around 7000 BC.<br \/><br \/>Roasting is a direct form of cooking: raw food meets flame and transforms. Boiling and frying are indirect forms. In addition to fire, they require a waterproof and fireproof vessel. The food only takes on the heat of the fire through a medium, whether oil for frying or water for boiling. This is an advance on crude fire, particularly when cooking something delicate such as an egg. But boiling water is not something encountered in nature very often.<br \/><br \/>Geothermal springs can be found in Iceland, Japan and New Zealand. They are sufficiently rare, however, that they still have the status of a natural wonder. In preindustrial times, living near hot springs must have been like having a samovar the size of a lake in your backyard: an improbable luxury. The Maori of New Zealand who lived close to the boiling pools of Whakarewarewa traditionally used them for cooking by placing food of various kinds \u2013 root vegetables, meats \u2013 in flaxen bags and suspending them in the water until cooked.

It\u2019s hard to imagine a modern kitchen\u00a0without pots and therefore hard to appreciate how many dishes we owe to this basic form of equipment. Pots enabled consumption of a far wider range of foods: many plants that had previously been toxic or at least indigestible became edible, once they could be boiled for several hours. Pots mark the leap from mere heating to cuisine: to the calm, considered intermingling of ingredients in a man-made vessel. Historically, the earliest cooking was roasting or barbecuing. Evidence of roasting goes back hundreds of thousands of years. By contrast, clay cooking pots date back only around 9,000 or 10,000 years. Large stone cooking pots from the Tehuaca Valley in Central America have also been found from sometime around 7000 BC.<br \/><br \/>Roasting is a direct form of cooking: raw food meets flame and transforms. Boiling and frying are indirect forms. In addition to fire, they require a waterproof and fireproof vessel. The food only takes on the heat of the fire through a medium, whether oil for frying or water for boiling. This is an advance on crude fire, particularly when cooking something delicate such as an egg. But boiling water is not something encountered in nature very often.<br \/><br \/>Geothermal springs can be found in Iceland, Japan and New Zealand. They are sufficiently rare, however, that they still have the status of a natural wonder. In preindustrial times, living near hot springs must have been like having a samovar the size of a lake in your backyard: an improbable luxury. The Maori of New Zealand who lived close to the boiling pools of Whakarewarewa traditionally used them for cooking by placing food of various kinds \u2013 root vegetables, meats \u2013 in flaxen bags and suspending them in the water until cooked. A similar technique has been practiced in the geothermal regions of Iceland for hundreds of years.\u00a0<br \/><br \/>Geothermal cooking has many advantages over fire cooking. It is less labour-intensive \u2013 all the work of creating a heat source is avoided. It is also gentler on the ingredients themselves. When cooking directly in the fire, it is hard to avoid the problem of charred on the outside and raw in the middle. Food bathed in hot water, on the other hand, can cook in its own good time; a few minutes more or less do not desperately matter.<br \/><br \/>Most people, however, do not live anywhere near geothermal springs. If you had only encountered cold water, what would it take for you to get the idea of heating it up to cook with? Water and fire are opposites; enemies, even.

The CA link is the most obvious one: C states that plate tectonics is 'just a hypothesis', and A, which begins with 'but', states that it is a 'hugely successful hypothesis'. This rules out option [2]. D makes most sense if is follows E, as D explains how the extremely small change in the gap between Europe and North America mentioned in E is measured. Thus [3], which lacks this link, is also ruled out. B fits better at the beginning of the sequence, as in [4], than in the middle, as in [1].
