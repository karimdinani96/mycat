Politeness in linguistics does not refer to social etiquette, like eating your peas without using your knife, but to the countless adjustments that speakers make to avoid the equally countless ways that their listeners might be put off. People are very, very touchy, and speakers go to great lengths not to step on their toes. In their magisterial work\u00a0<em>Politeness: Some Universals in Language Use<\/em>, the anthropologists Penelope Brown and Stephen Levinson show how people all over the world use politeness to lubricate their social interactions.<\/p><p class=\"body\">\u00a0<\/p><p class=\"body\">Politeness Theory begins with Erving Goffman's observation that when people interact they constantly worry about maintaining a nebulous yet vital commodity called 'face' (from the idiom 'to save face'). Goffman defined face as a positive social value that a person claims for himself. Brown and Levinson divide it into positive face, the desire to be approved (specifically, that other people want for you what you want for yourself), and negative face, the desire to be unimpeded or autonomous. The terminology, though clumsy, points to a fundamental duality in social life, which has been discovered in many guises and goes by many names: solidarity and status, connection and autonomy, communion and agency, intimacy and power, communal sharing and authority ranking.<\/p><p class=\"body\">\u00a0<\/p><p class=\"body\">According to Brown and Levinson, conversational partners work together, each trying to maintain his own face and the face of his counterpart. The challenge is that most kinds of speech pose at least some threat to the face of the hearer. The mere act of initiating a conversation imposes a demand on the hearer's time and attention. Issuing an imperative challenges her status and autonomy, as if the speaker feels entitled to boss her around. Making a request puts her in the position where she might have to refuse, earning her a reputation as stingy or selfish. Telling something to someone implies that she was ignorant of the fact in the first place. And then there are criticisms, boasts, interruptions, outbursts, the telling of bad news, and the broaching of divisive topics, all of which can injure the hearer's face directly. It's no surprise that the first thing out of our mouths when we address a stranger is a request for forgiveness:\u00a0<em>Excuse me<\/em>.<\/p><p class=\"body\">\u00a0<\/p><p class=\"body\">But despite the many ways in which a speaker can touch a nerve, he can't be constantly walking on eggshells. People have to get on with the business of life, and in doing so they have to convey requests and news and complaints. The solution is to make amends with politeness: the speaker sugarcoats his utterances with niceties that reaffirm his concern for the hearer or that acknowledge her autonomy. Brown and Levinson call the stratagems positive and negative politeness, but better terms are sympathy and deference.<\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br \/><\/span><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The essence of politeness-as-sympathy is to simulate a degree of closeness by pretending to want what the hearer wants for herself. Two witty lexicographers commented on this stratagem when defining the word politeness in their dictionaries. Samuel Johnson explained it as 'fictitious benevolence'; Ambrose Bierce called it 'the most acceptable hypocrisy'. Two familiar examples of politeness are the impotent bidding of good fortune (<em>Be well<\/em>, <em>Have a nice day<\/em>) and the feigned inquiry into the person's well-being (<em>How are you?<\/em>, <em>How's it going?<\/em>).

The same applies for [3]: the author shows that people can avoid threatening each others' face by using politeness. In the last sentence of the penultimate paragraph, the author mentions two types of politeness stratagems: sympathy and deference. In the last paragraph, he gives examples of politeness-as-sympathy.
