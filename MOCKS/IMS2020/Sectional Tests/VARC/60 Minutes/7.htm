It is actually a much older rule of thumb. A Latin name for it is lex parsimoniae, the law of parsimony. It is usually put into English as the maxim 'Do not multiply entities beyond necessity.' The idea is straightforward: don't concoct a complicated, extravagant theory if you've got a simpler one (containing fewer ingredients, fewer entities) that handles the phenomenon just as well. If exposure to extremely cold air can account for all the symptoms of frostbite, don't postulate unobserved 'snow germs' or 'arctic microbes'. Kepler's laws explain the orbits of the planets; we have no need to hypothesize pilots guiding the planets from control panels hidden under the surface. This much is uncontroversial, but extensions of the principle have not always met with agreement.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>Conwy Lloyd Morgan, a nineteenth-century British psychologist, extended the idea to cover attributions of mentality to animals. Lloyd Morgan's Canon of Parsimony advises us not to attribute fancy minds to insects, fish, and even dolphins, dogs and cats if their behaviour can be explained in simpler terms. Overused, this can be seen as enjoining us to treat all animals and even human beings as having brains but no minds. The tensions that arise when minds are the topic are not well settled by absolute prohibitions.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>One of the least impressive attempts to apply Occam's Razor to a difficult problem is the claim (and provoked counterclaims) that postulating a God as creator of the universe is simpler, more parsimonious, than the alternatives. How could postulating something supernatural and incomprehensible be parsimonious? It strikes me as the height of extravagance, but perhaps there are clever ways of rebutting that suggestion. I don't want to argue about it; Occam's Razor is, after all, just a rule of thumb, a frequently useful suggestion. The prospect of turning it into a Metaphysical Principle or Fundamental Requirement of Rationality that could bear the weight of proving or disproving the existence of God in one fell swoop is simply ludicrous. It would be like trying to disprove a theorem of quantum mechanics by showing that it contradicted the axiom 'Don't put all your eggs in one basket.'<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>Some thinkers have carried Occam's Razor to drastic extremes, using it to deny the existence of time, matter, numbers, holes, dollars, software, and so on. One of the earliest ultra-stingy thinkers was the ancient Greek philosopher Parmenides, whose catalogue of existing things was minimal indeed. As a student of mine memorably wrote on an exam, 'Parmenides is the one who said, \"There's just one thing - and I'm not it\".' I hate to say it, but that does seem to be what Parmenides was trying to tell us. No doubt it loses something in translation. We philosophers get used to taking such ideas seriously if only because we never can tell when a 'crazy' idea is going to turn out to be unfairly and unwisely judged, a victim of failure of imagination.<\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":true,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<p>In the first paragraph, the author explains what Occam's Razor is; in the rest of the passage, he talks about its applications, especially cases in which it is misapplied\u00a0\u00a0or of limited value.

To see one of these with the naked eye, you would need to magnify the dot to be 100 metres across. While huge, this is still imaginable. But to see the atomic nucleus you would need that dot to be enlarged to 10,000 kilometres: as big as the Earth from pole to pole.\u00a0<br \/><br \/>The simplest atom of hydrogen can give an idea of the scales and emptiness involved. The central nucleus is a single positively charged particle known as a proton. It is the path of the electron, remote from the central proton, that defines the outer limit of the atom. Journeying out from the centre of the atom, by the time we reach the edge of the proton we have only completed one ten thousandth of the journey. Eventually we reach the remote electron, whose size also is trifling, being less than one thousandth the size of the proton, or a ten millionth that of the atom. So an atom is apparently a perfect void: 99.9999999999999 per cent empty space. Even a comparison to outer space hardly does the atom\u2019s emptiness justice: the density of hydrogen atoms in outer space is huge compared to the density of particulate matter within each of those atoms!\u00a0<br \/><br \/>The atomic nucleus also is an ephemeral, wispy thing. Magnify a neutron or proton a thousand times and you would find that they too have a rich internal structure. Like a swarm of bees, which seen from afar appears as a dark spot whereas a close-up view shows the cloud buzzing with energy, so it is with the neutron or proton. To a low-powered image they appear like simple spots, but when viewed at high resolution they are found to be clusters of smaller particles called quarks. We had to enlarge the full stop to 100 metres to see an atom; to the diameter of the planet to see the nucleus.

About 2,500 years ago, a group of independent states that were in conflict with one another existed in the heartland of what we now call \u2018China\u2019. From 221 BCE, successive emperors and dynasties united these states, leading to a series of dynasties that created China\u2019s classical civilization: the Han, the Tang, the Song, the Yuan, the Ming and the Qing among them.

So why do people report feeling so pressed for time?<br \/><br \/>A beautiful explanation for this puzzling phenomenon was recently offered by Sanford\u00a0DeVoe of the University of Toronto and Jeffrey\u00a0Pfeffer of Stanford. They argue that as time becomes worth more and more money, time is seen as scarcer. Scarcity and value are perceived as conjoined twins; when a resource \u2013 from diamonds to drinking water \u2013 is scarce, it is more valuable, and vice versa. So when our time becomes more valuable, we feel as though we had less of it. Surveys around the world have shown that people with higher incomes report feeling more pressed for time \u2013 though there are other plausible reasons for this, including the fact that the affluent often work longer hours, leaving them with less free time.<br \/><br \/>DeVoe and\u00a0Pfeffer proposed, however, that simply perceiving oneself as affluent might be sufficient to generate feelings of time pressure. Going beyond past correlational analyses, they used controlled experiments to put this causal explanation to the test. In one experiment, they manipulated subjects into feeling like they had more money than they really had. Just feeling affluent led the subjects to experience the same sense of time pressure reported by genuinely affluent individuals. Using other methods, researchers have confirmed that increasing the perceived economic value of time increases its perceived scarcity.<br \/><br \/>If\u00a0feelings of time-scarcity stem in part from the sense that time is highly valuable, then one of the best things we can do to reduce this sense of pressure may be to give our time away. Indeed, new research suggests that giving time away to help others can actually alleviate feelings of time pressure. Companies like Home Depot provide their employees with opportunities to volunteer their time to help others, potentially reducing feelings of time stress and burnout. And Google encourages employees to use 20\u00a0percent of their time on their own pet projects, whether or not these have payoff potential. Although some of them resulted in economically valuable products, like Gmail, the greatest value of this programme might lie in reducing employees\u2019 sense that their time is scarce.<br \/><br \/>DeVoe and\u00a0Pfeffer\u2019s work can help account for important cultural trends. Over the past fifty years, feelings of time pressure have risen dramatically in North\u00a0America, despite the fact that weekly hours of work have stayed fairly level and weekly hours of leisure have climbed. This apparent paradox may be explained in no small part by the fact that incomes have increased substantially during the same period. This causal effect may also help to explain why people walk faster in wealthy cities like Tokyo and Toronto than they do in cities like Nairobi and Jakarta. And at the level of the individual, this explanation suggests that as incomes grow over the course of one\u2019s life, time seems increasingly scarce.<\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":false,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<p>Option [1] implies that time is inherently valuable, whereas the passage suggests the opposite: that people\u2019s view of the value of their time changes depending on the amount of money they make.

Surveys around the world have shown that people with higher incomes report feeling more pressed for time \u2013 though there are other plausible reasons for this, including the fact that the affluent often work longer hours, leaving them with less free time.<br \/><br \/>DeVoe and\u00a0Pfeffer proposed, however, that simply perceiving oneself as affluent might be sufficient to generate feelings of time pressure. Going beyond past correlational analyses, they used controlled experiments to put this causal explanation to the test. In one experiment, they manipulated subjects into feeling like they had more money than they really had. Just feeling affluent led the subjects to experience the same sense of time pressure reported by genuinely affluent individuals. Using other methods, researchers have confirmed that increasing the perceived economic value of time increases its perceived scarcity.<br \/><br \/>If\u00a0feelings of time-scarcity stem in part from the sense that time is highly valuable, then one of the best things we can do to reduce this sense of pressure may be to give our time away. Indeed, new research suggests that giving time away to help others can actually alleviate feelings of time pressure. Companies like Home Depot provide their employees with opportunities to volunteer their time to help others, potentially reducing feelings of time stress and burnout. And Google encourages employees to use 20\u00a0percent of their time on their own pet projects, whether or not these have payoff potential. Although some of them resulted in economically valuable products, like Gmail, the greatest value of this programme might lie in reducing employees\u2019 sense that their time is scarce.<br \/><br \/>DeVoe and\u00a0Pfeffer\u2019s work can help account for important cultural trends. Over the past fifty years, feelings of time pressure have risen dramatically in North\u00a0America, despite the fact that weekly hours of work have stayed fairly level and weekly hours of leisure have climbed. This apparent paradox may be explained in no small part by the fact that incomes have increased substantially during the same period. This causal effect may also help to explain why people walk faster in wealthy cities like Tokyo and Toronto than they do in cities like Nairobi and Jakarta.
