'We have learnt nothing!' is reported as his awed, almost indignant comment, implying that the anonymous Stone Age draughtsmen of Lascaux had miraculously anticipated the representational aims and achievements of art within modern, 'civilized' society. Picasso's reaction is one that many of us would share. Identifying the precise species of animals in these paintings might be beyond us, but we have little essential difficulty in seeing what these ancient artists were trying to represent. Instinctively, then, we may want to 'update' the earliest human artists by assuming that they painted for the sheer joy of painting.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\" lang=\"EN-US\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\" lang=\"EN-US\">This simple acceptance of cave-paintings as art for art's sake has a certain appeal. To think of Lascaux as a gallery or salon allows it to be a sort of special viewing place where the handiwork of accomplished artists might be displayed. And at Lascaux, the evident care with which individual animals have been abstracted from any natural background or landscape makes it tempting to suppose that the painters sought to create, as it were, 'life studies' of their subjects. Plausibly, the people of Palaeolithic Europe had the leisure time for art.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\" lang=\"EN-US\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\" lang=\"EN-US\">The problems with this explanation, however, are various. In the first place, the proliferation of archaeological discoveries of rock art sites around the world has served to emphasize a remarkably limited repertoire of subjects. The images that recur are those of animals; and, commonly, similar types of animal. Human figures are unusual; and when they do make an appearance, they are rarely done with the same attention to form accorded to the animals. If Palaeolithic artists were simply seeking to represent the beauty of the world around them, would they not have left a far greater range of pictures \u2013 of trees and flowers, of the sun and the stars?<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\" lang=\"EN-US\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\" lang=\"EN-US\">A further question to the theory of art for art's sake is posed by the high incidence of Palaeolithic images that appear not be imitative of any reality whatsoever. These are geometrical shapes or patterns consisting of dots or lines. A good example of this may be seen in the geologically spectacular grotto of Pech Merle in France. Here we encounter some favourite animals from the Palaeolithic repertoire \u2013 a pair of stout-bellied horses. But over and around the horses' outlines are multiple dark spots, daubed in disregard for the otherwise naturalistic representation of the animals.

So the passage cannot be called an experiment or even a study, and thus [1] and [2] are incorrect. [4] is extreme: though the author is sceptical and mocking of the experiment conducted in this passage, we cannot infer this to mean that he is denouncing the concept of prayer itself; rather, he may be simply ridiculing the notion that prayer can be scientifically studied. [3] best describes the passage, as the author reports on the failure of a scientific experiment that set out to study the effectiveness of prayer.

In the nineteenth century, Francis Galton was the first to analyse scientifically whether praying for people is efficacious. He noted that every Sunday, in churches throughout Britain, entire congregations prayed publicly for the health of the royal family. Shouldn't they, therefore, be unusually fit, compared with the rest of us, who are prayed for only by our nearest and dearest? Galton looked into it, and found no statistical difference. His intention may, in any case, have been satirical, as also when he prayed over randomized plots of land to see if the plants would grow any faster (they didn't).<\/p> <p class=\"body\">\u00a0<\/p> <p class=\"body\">\u00a0<\/p> <p class=\"body\">More recently, the physicist Russell Stannard threw his weight behind an initiative to test experimentally the proposition that praying for sick patients improves their health. Such experiments, if done properly, have to be double blind, and this standard was strictly observed. The patients were assigned, strictly at random, to an experimental group (received prayers) or a control group (received no prayers). Neither the patients, nor their doctors or caregivers, nor the experimenters were allowed to know which patients were being prayed for and which patients were controls. Those who did the experimental praying had to know the names of the individuals for whom they were praying \u2013 otherwise, in what sense would they be praying for them rather than for somebody else? But care was taken to tell them only the first name and initial letter of the surname. Apparently that would be enough to enable God to pinpoint the right hospital bed.<\/p> <p class=\"body\">\u00a0<\/p> <p class=\"body\">\u00a0<\/p> <p class=\"body\">The very idea of doing such experiments is open to a generous measure of ridicule, and the project duly received it. Valiantly shouldering aside all mockery, the team of researchers soldiered on, spending $2.4 million under the leadership of Dr Herbert Benson, a cardiologist at the Mind\/Body Medical Institute near Boston. Dr Benson and his team monitored 1,802 patients at six hospitals, all of whom received coronary bypass surgery. The patients were divided into three groups. Group 1 received prayers and didn't know it. Group 2 (the control group) received no prayers and didn't know it. Group 3 received prayers and did know it. The comparison between Groups 1 and 2 tests for the efficacy of intercessory prayer. Group 3 tests for possible psychosomatic effects of knowing that one is being prayed for.<\/p> <p class=\"body\">\u00a0<\/p> <p class=\"body\">\u00a0<\/p> <p>The results, reported in the\u00a0<em>American Heart Journal<\/em>, were clear-cut. There was no difference between those patients who were prayed for and those who were not. What a surprise. There was a difference between those who knew they had been prayed for and those who did not know one way or the other; but it went in the wrong direction. Those who knew they had been the beneficiaries of prayer suffered significantly more complications than those who did not. Was God doing a bit of smiting, to show his disapproval of the whole silly enterprise? It seems more probable that those patients who knew they were being prayed for suffered additional stress in consequence: 'performance anxiety', as the experimenters put it. It may have made them uncertain, wondering 'Am I so sick they had to call in their prayer team?'<\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":false,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> According to the second paragraph, 'the physicist Russell Stannard threw his weight behind' the experiment; that does not necessarily mean he designed it. So [1] cannot be inferred. According to the same paragraph, the 'double blind' standards for the experiment were strictly followed, and no other protocols are mentioned, so [2] is incorrect. All the patients in the experiment received coronary bypass surgery, so [3] cannot be inferred. Only [4] can be inferred: the patients in Group 3 \u2013 the ones who received prayers and did know it \u2013 were affected by the prayers, in the sense that it made them worse, not better, as they were more stressed to learn that people were praying for their recovery.
