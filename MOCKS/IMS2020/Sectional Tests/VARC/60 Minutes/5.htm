The majority of this passage lists the cons of security theatre; the pros are mentioned only in the third paragraph, and even these are applicable only sometimes and in a few localized situations. So [3] is not a particularly suitable title. The passage mainly explains the concept of security theatre and the problems with it.

While Nate Silver would probably agree with [2] and [3], they are not what his remark is about at all.

Some experts have described the airport security repercussions due to the September 11, 2001 attacks as security theatre.<\/p><p class=\"body\">\u00a0<\/p><p class=\"body\">Security theatre has real monetary costs but by definition provides no security benefits, or the benefits are so minimal as to not be worth the cost. Security theatre typically involves restricting or modifying aspects of people's behaviour or surroundings in very visible and highly specific ways, that could involve potential restrictions of personal liberty and privacy, ranging from negligible (confiscating water bottles where bottled water can later be purchased) to significant (prolonged screening of individuals to the point of harassment).<\/p><p class=\"body\">\u00a0<\/p><p class=\"body\">While it may seem that security theatre must always cause loss, it may\u00a0<em>sometimes<\/em>\u00a0be beneficial, at least in a localized situation. This is because perception of security is sometimes more important than security itself. If the potential victims of an attack feel more protected and safer as a result of the measures, then they may carry on activities they would have otherwise avoided. In addition, if the security measures in place appear effective, potential attackers may be dissuaded from proceeding or may direct their attention to a target perceived as less secure. Unsophisticated adversaries in particular may be frightened by superficial impressions of security (such as seeing multiple people in uniform or observing cameras) and not even attempt to find weaknesses or determine effect.<\/p><p class=\"body\">\u00a0<\/p><p class=\"body\">However, critics such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have argued that the benefits of security theatre are temporary and illusory since after such security measures inevitably fail, not only is the feeling of insecurity increased, but there is also loss of belief in the competence of those responsible for security. Security theatre encourages people to make uninformed, counterproductive political decisions. The feeling of (and wished for) safety can actually increase the real risk. The disruption, cost and fear caused by security theatre acts as positive feedback for those who wish to exploit it: even if they fail to take lives, they can cause large economic costs.<\/p><p class=\"body\">\u00a0<\/p><p class=\"body\">A group of Cornell University researchers have found that strict airport security in the United States after the 9\/11 attacks has the unintended consequence of increasing road fatalities, as would-be air travellers decide to drive and are exposed to the far greater risk of dying in a car accident. In 2005, the researchers looked at the immediate aftermath of the attacks of September 11, 2001, and found that the change in passenger travel modes led to 242 added driving deaths per month. In all, they estimated that about 1,200 driving deaths could be attributed to the short-term effects of the attacks. Extrapolating this rate of fatalities,\u00a0<em>New York Times<\/em>\u00a0contributor Nate Silver remarked that this is equivalent to 'four fully loaded Boeing 737s crashing each year'.<\/p><p class=\"body\">\u00a0<\/p><p class=\"body\">The Cornell study also noted that strict airport security hurts the airline industry; it was estimated that the 6% reduction in the number of passengers in the fourth quarter of 2002 cost the industry $1.1 billion in lost business.<\/p><p class=\"body\">\u00a0<\/p><p class=\"body\">The direct costs of security theatre may be lower than that of more elaborate security measures. However, it may divert portions of the budget for effective security measures without resulting in an adequate, measurable gain in security. Such ripple effects are often connected to fear; visible measures such as armed guards and highly intrusive security measures may lead people to believe that there must be a real risk associated with their activity.<\/p><p class=\"body\">\u00a0<\/p><p class=\"body\">Because security theatre measures are often so specific (such as concentrating on potential explosives in shoes), it allows potential attackers to divert to other methods of attack. This not only applies to the extremely specific measures, but can also involve possible tactics such as switching from using highly scrutinized airline passengers as attackers to getting attackers employed as airline or airport staff. Another alternate tactic would be simply avoiding attacking aircraft in favour of attacking other areas where sufficient damage would be done, such as cinemas.<\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":false,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> The majority of the passage lists the disadvantages of security theatre, and even its benefits are questioned.

And as firms move into new, far-flung markets, they have often had to look beyond their ranks for managers, both local and expatriate, with specialized knowledge.

Two of the top four firms, Heidrick & Struggles and Spencer Stuart, were set up by former consultants from Booz Allen & Hamilton. But clients feared the consultants would suggest the creation of new jobs in order to be able to charge for filling them.

The EIU estimates that revenues for the top headhunters (or executive-search firms, as they call themselves) rose by 35-40% last year.

But two other changes have also helped the executive searchers. As the settled management patterns of seniority have crumbled, top managers are switching jobs much more rapidly. And as firms move into new, far-flung markets, they have often had to look beyond their ranks for managers, both local and expatriate, with specialized knowledge. A recent survey by Amrop International, a headhunter, and Harvard Business School, found that multinational companies expect 74% of their managers to be host-country nationals in five years' time, compared with 45% today.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-indent: 0cm; line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-indent: 0cm; line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">All this has given headhunters more work on both sides of the Atlantic.

Two of the top four firms, Heidrick & Struggles and Spencer Stuart, were set up by former consultants from Booz Allen & Hamilton. But clients feared the consultants would suggest the creation of new jobs in order to be able to charge for filling them.

It has not always been clear how these rocks were formed, nor even that they represented rocks of a fundamentally different cast. Igneous rocks originated from molten magma deep within the Earth's crust, which solidified as it cooled. They are nearly always crystalline, and frequently very hard. Granite, basalt, pumice and gabbro are all varieties of igneous rocks. Because of their hardness and resistance to weathering igneous rocks may form the major features in a landscape. They protrude against sky and sea. They can be attacked by the weather (as can everything except gold and platinum), but this attack is slow, extraordinarily slow. This is why islands made of igneous rocks remain, battered by every storm, while all the rocks around them are eroded into oblivion.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\" lang=\"EN-US\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"body\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\" lang=\"EN-US\">The two main types of igneous rocks are volcanic, the product of eruption, and plutonic, which formed deep in the Earth's crust in the very bowels of the Earth. Those formed in Pluto's domain often cooled slowly, and had time to grow large crystals. Look at almost any city kerbstone, which will probably be made of granite, and the big pink or white crystals can be seen with the naked eye. Plutonic rocks may form not merely mountains but mountain ranges. Vulcan's rocks were formed violently, from a forge of fire, spewed from vents or extruded in incandescent clouds, and forged in different ways, too, so that they can look quite different: twisted or blocky or piled in flow upon flow.
