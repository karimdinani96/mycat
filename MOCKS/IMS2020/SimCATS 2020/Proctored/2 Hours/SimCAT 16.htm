Choose the best answer for each question.<\/b><br><br>Although vipers are famous for their venomous bites, it turns out these snakes have another story to tell. By studying the genetic diversity of the neotropical rattlesnake, scientists can reconstruct how the South American landscape may have looked millions of years ago. <br><br>Neotropical rattlesnakes are found in dry, arid parts of South America and small savannah pockets in the Amazon. Many of these snake populations are discontinuous \u2014 or separated from one another by wet rainforest habitat. Although these populations are all part of the same species, they have small, but noticeable genetic differences. These differences can signal when and where populations stopped interbreeding and became geographically isolated. But it is difficult to picture how and when these gradual changes happened.<br><br>At the  National Museum of Natural History, Dr Edward Myers \u2013 a postdoctoral fellow in the Division of Amphibians and Reptiles \u2014 has built environmental models for neotropical rattlesnakes in ancient South America using data from the museum's collection. By combining his models with genetic records from present populations, Myers can map how this viper once slithered across South America, leaving behind several marooned populations in savanna islands surrounded by a sea of inhospitable tropical rainforest. <br><br>Most of the museum's rattlesnake specimens are catalogued with a precise location and date. Myers has paired this information with climate data, like average temperature and precipitation, from databases like WorldClim to determine what climate range the snakes can live in. What they prefer now is similar to what they preferred in the past.<br><br>\"By projecting what we know about this species' current environment, we can find where this species could have lived in ancient South America,\" said Myers. Since today's separated populations are genetically alike enough to count as one species, they must have been in the \"not too distant past,\" which to an evolutionary biologist means one point in the last few million years. This suggests that currently isolated populations were probably once connected by rattlesnake-suitable environments that have since disappeared. <br><br>Climate models show how the continent's landscape changed over time, giving Myers's a hypothetical timeframe for when different colonies may have splintered. \"You can use climate models as a hypothesis for what a pattern of genetic diversity in the species should look like today,\" said Dr Rayna Bell, an evolutionary biologist at the California Academy of Sciences and one of Myers's collaborators. Sequencing the snake's genomic records can be used as a test for Myers's environmental models.<br><br>As the South American environment changed, some regions became less hospitable for rattlesnakes.

Choose the best answer for each question.<br \/><br \/>The unifying theme for much of modern biology is based on Charles Darwin&rsquo;s theory of evolution, the process of natural selection by which nature selects the fittest, best-adapted organisms to reproduce, multiply and survive. As organisms change and new variants thrive, species emerge and evolve. &hellip; But over the past century, advances in genetics and molecular biology have outlined a modern, neo-Darwinian theory of how evolution works: DNA sequences randomly mutate, and organisms with the specific sequences best adapted to the environment multiply and prevail. But this explanation for evolution turns out to be incomplete&hellip; <br \/><br \/>One problem with Darwin&rsquo;s theory is that, while species do evolve more adaptive traits (called phenotypes), the rate of random DNA sequence mutation turns out to be too slow to explain many of the changes. Scientists, well-aware of the issue, have proposed a variety of genetic mechanisms to compensate: genetic drift, in which small groups of individuals undergo dramatic genetic change; or epistasis, in which one set of genes suppress another, to name just two.<br \/><br \/>Yet even with such mechanisms in play, genetic mutation rates for complex organisms such as humans are dramatically lower than the frequency of change for a host of traits&hellip; The rapid emergence of trait variety is difficult to explain just through classic genetics and neo-Darwinian theory. &hellip; Part of the explanation can be found in some concepts that Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed 50 years before Darwin published his work. Lamarck&rsquo;s theory, long relegated to the dustbin of science, held, among other things, &lsquo;that the environment can directly alter traits, which are then inherited by generations to come&rsquo;. &hellip; At the start, Lamarck might have been pilloried as a religious heretic, but in modern times, it is the orthodoxy of science &ndash; and especially Darwin&rsquo;s untouchable theory of evolution &ndash; that has caused his name to be treated as a joke. Yet by the end of his career, Darwin himself had come around; even without the benefit of molecular biology, he could see that random changes were not fast enough to support his theory in full. <br \/><br \/>The question is this: if natural selection isn&rsquo;t acting on genetic mutations alone, then what molecular forces create the full suite of variation in traits required for natural selection to finish the job? One clue came &hellip; in 1953, just as James Watson and Francis Crick were unravelling the mysteries of DNA and the double helix. In that year, the developmental biologist Conrad Waddington of the University of Edinburgh reported that fruit flies exposed to outside chemical stimulus or changes in temperature during embryonic development could be pushed to develop varying wing structures. The changes the scientists induced in that single generation would, thereafter, be inherited by progeny down the lineage. Waddington coined a modern term &ndash; &lsquo;epigenetics&rsquo; &ndash; to describe this phenomenon of rapid change. <br \/><br \/>Although Waddington described the general role of epigenetics, he was no more aware of the molecular elements or mechanisms involved than Lamarck or Darwin.

Lamarck&rsquo;s theory, long relegated to the dustbin of science, held, among other things, &lsquo;that the environment can directly alter traits, which are then inherited by generations to come&rsquo;. &hellip; At the start, Lamarck might have been pilloried as a religious heretic, but in modern times, it is the orthodoxy of science &ndash; and especially Darwin&rsquo;s untouchable theory of evolution &ndash; that has caused his name to be treated as a joke. Yet by the end of his career, Darwin himself had come around; even without the benefit of molecular biology, he could see that random changes were not fast enough to support his theory in full. <br \/><br \/>The question is this: if natural selection isn&rsquo;t acting on genetic mutations alone, then what molecular forces create the full suite of variation in traits required for natural selection to finish the job? One clue came &hellip; in 1953, just as James Watson and Francis Crick were unravelling the mysteries of DNA and the double helix. In that year, the developmental biologist Conrad Waddington of the University of Edinburgh reported that fruit flies exposed to outside chemical stimulus or changes in temperature during embryonic development could be pushed to develop varying wing structures. The changes the scientists induced in that single generation would, thereafter, be inherited by progeny down the lineage. Waddington coined a modern term &ndash; &lsquo;epigenetics&rsquo; &ndash; to describe this phenomenon of rapid change. <br \/><br \/>Although Waddington described the general role of epigenetics, he was no more aware of the molecular elements or mechanisms involved than Lamarck or Darwin. But the more molecular biology decodes the workings of life, the more Waddington&rsquo;s concepts &ndash; and Lamarck&rsquo;s &ndash; make sense. Indeed, although the vast majority of environmental factors cannot directly alter the molecular sequence of DNA, they do regulate a host of epigenetic mechanisms that regulate how DNA functions &ndash; turning the expression of genes up or down, or dictating how proteins, the products of our genes, are expressed in cells.<\/p>","PassageTitle":"q10","IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\tT<span style=\"font-family: ;\">he first paragraph explains Darwin<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">\u2019s<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">theory:<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\"> \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">the&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">process of natural selection by which nature selects the fittest, best-adapted organisms to reproduce, multiply and survive.\u201d However, this is an incomplete theory: \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">while&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">species do evolve more adaptive traits (called phenotypes), the rate of random DNA sequence mutation turns<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> ou<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">t to be too slow to&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">explain many of the changes...\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Darwinism was unable to explain these changes [phenotypes\u2014<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> traits evolved in response to environment<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">] that species evolve over a shorter period<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">.
