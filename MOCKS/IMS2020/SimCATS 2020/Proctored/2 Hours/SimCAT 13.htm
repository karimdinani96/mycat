When sheep were introduced to Tasmania in 1824, the European settlers developed a bitter rivalry with the striped marsupial, which they blamed for lost livestock. By 1830, cash bounties encouraged people to hunt and kill the animals, despite evidence that feral dogs and mismanagement were primarily responsible for the lost sheep, according to the NMoA.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-size: 14.7px;\">Hunting, extensive habitat destruction and invasive diseases, such as mange, exacted a heavy toll on the surviving population, which was considered rare by 1910, according to the Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-size: 14.7px;\">Benjamin, the thylacine that appears in the newly discovered video, was captured in the wild in 1933 before being delivered to the Beaumaris Zoo, reported Natsumi Penberthy for Australian Geographic in 2016.

When sheep were introduced to Tasmania in 1824, the European settlers developed a bitter rivalry with the striped marsupial, which they blamed for lost livestock. By 1830, cash bounties encouraged people to hunt and kill the animals, despite evidence that feral dogs and mismanagement were primarily responsible for the lost sheep, according to the NMoA.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-size: 14.7px;\">Hunting, extensive habitat destruction and invasive diseases, such as mange, exacted a heavy toll on the surviving population, which was considered rare by 1910, according to the Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-size: 14.7px;\">Benjamin, the thylacine that appears in the newly discovered video, was captured in the wild in 1933 before being delivered to the Beaumaris Zoo, reported Natsumi Penberthy for Australian Geographic in 2016.

Instead of relying on intuition and carefully-formulated questions or hypotheses, we can use data to discover patterns that once escaped our notice. Success in sports, the effectiveness of political ads and the use of language by liars are examples where data analysis has yielded new insights.

That it makes the world predictable and brings it under control is beyond dispute; that algorithms which process data make better decisions than humans, and that we had better outsource decisions as a result, is evident.

A molecule produced by neurons in the hypothalamus, oxytocin is known for coordinating bonding, sociality, and group living. From the hypothalamus, oxytocin targets receptors in the body and the brain, primarily the amygdala, a centre for fear and vigilance; the hippocampus, where memory resides; and the striatum, a locus of motivation and reward. Through these pathways, oxytocin functions with the precision of a neurotransmitter and the longevity of a hormone, reaching faraway locations and influencing behaviour. Importantly, oxytocin is also released through the extensions of neurons called dendrites. The dendrites are primed to increase oxytocin release whenever attachment memories are invoked.

These same memories enable what the English psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott described as \u2018the capacity to be alone\u2019 in the presence of someone in a state of peace and serenity, where aloneness is not loneliness. Throughout life, during periods of bond-formation oxytocin production increases to cement the new bond as it does at birth. During birth, a surge of oxytocin triggers uterine contractions, and oxytocin release initiates milk letdown. Maternal oxytocin is then transferred to the infant through the mother\u2019s milk, touch and caregiving behaviour. It bonds mother and child forever but it also reorganises the infant\u2019s brain to love and what it takes to feel safe.

Hence the system supports regulation of basic life-sustaining functions: water conservation, thermoregulation or energy balance in species such as nematodes, frogs or reptiles. With the evolution of mammals, oxytocin became integrally involved in controlling birth and lactation; as a result, the young acquired life sustaining functions and skills not in the context of the group but within the intimacy of the mother-infant bond. This created the main schism - the core conflict of the human condition: mammals learn to manage hardship through relationships, and bonding is their key mechanism for stress reduction. Being born a mammal, then, implies that oxytocin, the very system that sustains parental care, pair-bonds, group sharing, and consoling behaviour, also became intensely sensitive to danger. Oxytocin protects against danger by immediately differentiating \u201cfriend\u201d from \u201cfoe\u201d based on nuances of social behaviour. When mammals perceive slight alterations in social behaviour, they identify the approach of \u2018others\u2019, activating the alarm systems of the fight-or-flight response and their bodies prepare to attack.

Through these pathways, oxytocin functions with the precision of a neurotransmitter and the longevity of a hormone, reaching faraway locations and influencing behaviour. Importantly, oxytocin is also released through the extensions of neurons called dendrites. The dendrites are primed to increase oxytocin release whenever attachment memories are invoked. This way, early attachments prime us for a lifetime, and we keep seeking echoes of early experiences in later relationships.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-size: 14.7px;\">Memory of these early attachments helps us re-enact the unique state that Sue Carter, a neurobiologist, calls \u2018immobility without fear\u2019. These same memories enable what the English psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott described as \u2018the capacity to be alone\u2019 in the presence of someone in a state of peace and serenity, where aloneness is not loneliness. Throughout life, during periods of bond-formation oxytocin production increases to cement the new bond as it does at birth. During birth, a surge of oxytocin triggers uterine contractions, and oxytocin release initiates milk letdown. Maternal oxytocin is then transferred to the infant through the mother\u2019s milk, touch and caregiving behaviour. It bonds mother and child forever but it also reorganises the infant\u2019s brain to love and what it takes to feel safe. This is how cultures \u2018stamp\u2019 the infant\u2019s brain with the distinct social patterns that reflect their philosophies on human relationships, particularly those across the generational divide. <\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-size: 14.7px;\">Still, oxytocin is an ancient system that functions in a quick-and-dirty way; no time for complexities when the lion is at your door \u2026 Its role across animal evolution was to help organisms manage life in harsh ecologies. Hence the system supports regulation of basic life-sustaining functions: water conservation, thermoregulation or energy balance in species such as nematodes, frogs or reptiles. With the evolution of mammals, oxytocin became integrally involved in controlling birth and lactation; as a result, the young acquired life sustaining functions and skills not in the context of the group but within the intimacy of the mother-infant bond. This created the main schism - the core conflict of the human condition: mammals learn to manage hardship through relationships, and bonding is their key mechanism for stress reduction. Being born a mammal, then, implies that oxytocin, the very system that sustains parental care, pair-bonds, group sharing, and consoling behaviour, also became intensely sensitive to danger. Oxytocin protects against danger by immediately differentiating \u201cfriend\u201d from \u201cfoe\u201d based on nuances of social behaviour. When mammals perceive slight alterations in social behaviour, they identify the approach of \u2018others\u2019, activating the alarm systems of the fight-or-flight response and their bodies prepare to attack.

As a part of their Marketing Management course, they had to conduct a market survey in order to ascertain the views of the people about a new product. The methodology of the market survey involved taking interviews of the people visiting Phoenix United Mall in the city. The interviews were conducted by each of them over a six week duration (denoted as Week-I to Week-VI).<br \/><br \/>The professor who taught the course prepared a report on the total number of the interviews conducted by the students as well as the total number of weekly interviews conducted. The professor was shocked to see that Fredrick had not conducted any interview. However, later the professor realized that by mistake he had forgotten to consider the number of interviews taken by Fredrick in the first place.
