Choose the best answer for each question.<\/b><\/span><br><br>In India, solid waste management, with the emergence of e-waste, has become a complicated task. The total waste generated by obsolete or broken down electronic and electrical equipment was estimated to be 1,46,000 tonnes for the year 2005, which is expected to exceed 8,00,000 tonnes by 2012. However, according to the Greenpeace Report, in 2007, India generated 3,80,000 tonnes of e-waste. Only 3% of this made it to the authorised recyclers\u2019 facilities. One of the reasons for this is, India has also become a dumping ground for many developed nations. The Basel Action Network (BAN) stated in a report that 50-80% of e-waste collected by the USA is exported to India, China, Pakistan, Taiwan, and several African countries. India is one of the fastest-growing economies of the world, and the domestic demand for consumer durables has been skyrocketing. From 1998 to 2002, there was a 53.1% increase in the sales of domestic household appliances, both large and small all over the world. Another report estimated that in India, business and individual households make approximately 1.38 million personal computers obsolete every year, accelerating the rate of e-waste generation, which is around 10%, annually going to affect environmental health indicators.<br><br>Electronic equipment contains many hazardous metallic contaminants such as lead, cadmium, and beryllium and brominated flame-retardants. The fraction including iron, copper, aluminium, gold, and other metals in e-waste is over 60%, while plastics account for about 30% and the hazardous pollutants comprise only about 2.70%. Of many toxic heavy metals, lead is the most widely used in electronic devices for various purposes, resulting in a variety of health hazards due to environmental contamination. Lead enters biological systems via food, water, air, and soil. Children are particularly vulnerable to lead poisoning \u2013 more so than adults because they absorb more lead from their environment and their nervous system and blood gets affected. It is found that the e-waste recycling activities had contributed to the elevated blood lead levels in children living in China, which is one of the popular destinations of e-waste. This was due to that fact that the processes and techniques used during the recycling activities were very primitive. Various studies have reported the soaring levels of toxic heavy metals and organic contaminants in samples of dust, soil, river sediment, surface water, and groundwater of Guiyu in China. In the same areas, the residents had a high incidence of skin damage, headaches, vertigo, nausea, chronic gastritis, and gastric and duodenal ulcers.  Further, it was found that the blood lead levels of children were higher than the mean level in China, and there was no significant difference between boys and girls.<br><br>It was found that e-waste recycling operations were causing higher levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD\/Fs) in the environment as well as in humans. Body burdens of people in hair, human milk, and placenta from the e-waste processing site showed significantly higher levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD\/Fs) than those from the non-processing site.

Choose the best answer for each question.<\/b><\/span><br><br>In India, solid waste management, with the emergence of e-waste, has become a complicated task. The total waste generated by obsolete or broken down electronic and electrical equipment was estimated to be 1,46,000 tonnes for the year 2005, which is expected to exceed 8,00,000 tonnes by 2012. However, according to the Greenpeace Report, in 2007, India generated 3,80,000 tonnes of e-waste. Only 3% of this made it to the authorised recyclers\u2019 facilities. One of the reasons for this is, India has also become a dumping ground for many developed nations. The Basel Action Network (BAN) stated in a report that 50-80% of e-waste collected by the USA is exported to India, China, Pakistan, Taiwan, and several African countries. India is one of the fastest-growing economies of the world, and the domestic demand for consumer durables has been skyrocketing. From 1998 to 2002, there was a 53.1% increase in the sales of domestic household appliances, both large and small all over the world. Another report estimated that in India, business and individual households make approximately 1.38 million personal computers obsolete every year, accelerating the rate of e-waste generation, which is around 10%, annually going to affect environmental health indicators.<br><br>Electronic equipment contains many hazardous metallic contaminants such as lead, cadmium, and beryllium and brominated flame-retardants. The fraction including iron, copper, aluminium, gold, and other metals in e-waste is over 60%, while plastics account for about 30% and the hazardous pollutants comprise only about 2.70%. Of many toxic heavy metals, lead is the most widely used in electronic devices for various purposes, resulting in a variety of health hazards due to environmental contamination. Lead enters biological systems via food, water, air, and soil. Children are particularly vulnerable to lead poisoning \u2013 more so than adults because they absorb more lead from their environment and their nervous system and blood gets affected. It is found that the e-waste recycling activities had contributed to the elevated blood lead levels in children living in China, which is one of the popular destinations of e-waste. This was due to that fact that the processes and techniques used during the recycling activities were very primitive. Various studies have reported the soaring levels of toxic heavy metals and organic contaminants in samples of dust, soil, river sediment, surface water, and groundwater of Guiyu in China. In the same areas, the residents had a high incidence of skin damage, headaches, vertigo, nausea, chronic gastritis, and gastric and duodenal ulcers.  Further, it was found that the blood lead levels of children were higher than the mean level in China, and there was no significant difference between boys and girls.<br><br>It was found that e-waste recycling operations were causing higher levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD\/Fs) in the environment as well as in humans. Body burdens of people in hair, human milk, and placenta from the e-waste processing site showed significantly higher levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD\/Fs) than those from the non-processing site. There is a paucity of data on burdens of massive metal exposure on the human body in India.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<p style=\"margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; background: white;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; color: #222222;\">Answer: Option 3<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; background: white; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; word-spacing: 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; color: #222222;\">Statement 1 isn&rsquo;t justifiable from para 2 and isn&rsquo;t exactly specific to the example of China.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; background: white; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; word-spacing: 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; color: #222222;\">Statement 2 can be understood from the last 3 sentences of the 2nd paragraph from &ldquo;Various studies &hellip;till the end of the paragraph&rdquo;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; background: white; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; word-spacing: 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; color: #222222;\">Statement 3 can be understood from the statement &ldquo;It is found that the e-waste recycling activities had contributed to the elevated blood lead levels in children living in China, which is one of the popular destinations of e-waste.

Choose the best answer for each question.<\/b><\/span><br><br>The ancient Stoic philosophers like Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and Epictetus regularly conducted an exercise known as a premeditatio malorum, which translates to a \u201cpremeditation of evils.\u201d<br><br>The goal of this exercise was to envision the negative things that could happen in life. For example, the Stoics would imagine what it would be like to lose their job and become homeless, or to suffer an injury and become paralyzed, or to have their reputation ruined and lose their status in society.<br><br>The Stoics believed that by imagining the worst-case scenario ahead of time, they could overcome their fears of negative experiences and make better plans to prevent them. While most people were focused on how they could achieve success, the Stoics also considered how they would manage failure. What would things look like if everything went wrong tomorrow? And what does this tell us about how we should prepare today?<br><br>This way of thinking, in which you consider the opposite of what you want, is known as inversion. When I first learned of it, I didn't realize how powerful it could be. As I have studied it more, I have begun to realize that inversion is a rare and crucial skill that nearly all great thinkers use to their advantage. <br><br>The German mathematician Carl Jacobi made a number of important contributions to different scientific fields during his career. In particular, he was known for his ability to solve hard problems by following a strategy of man muss immer umkehren or, loosely translated, \u201cinvert, always invert.\u201d<br><br>Jacobi believed that one of the best ways to clarify your thinking was to restate math problems in inverse form. He would write down the opposite of the problem he was trying to solve and found that the solution often came to him more easily.<br><br>Inversion is a powerful thinking tool because it puts a spotlight on errors and roadblocks that are not obvious at first glance. What if the opposite was true? What if I focused on a different side of this situation? Instead of asking how to do something, ask how to not do it.<br><br>Great thinkers, icons, and innovators think forward and backward. They consider the opposite side of things. Occasionally, they drive their brain in reverse. This way of thinking can reveal compelling opportunities for innovation.<br><br>Art provides several good examples. One of the biggest musical shifts in the last several decades came from Nirvana, a band that legitimized a whole new genre of music\u2014alternative rock\u2014and whose Nevermind album is memorialized in the Library of Congress as one of the most \u201cculturally, historically or aesthetically important\u201d recordings of the 20<sup>th<\/sup> century. <br><br>Nirvana turned the conventions of mainstream rock and pop music completely upside down. Where hair metal bands like Poison and Def Leppard spent millions to produce and promote each record, Nirvana recorded Nevermind for $65,000. Where hair metal was flashy, Nirvana was stripped-down and raw. Inversion is often at the core of great art.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span>The correct answer is (3) because this is not a fact according to the passage.
