Choose the best answer for each question.<\/strong> <br \/><br \/>Your mouth is currently teeming with giant viruses that, until very recently, no one knew existed. Unlike Ebola or the new coronavirus that&rsquo;s currently making headlines, these particular viruses don&rsquo;t cause disease in humans. They&rsquo;re part of a group known as phages, which infect and kill bacteria. But while many phages are well studied,&nbsp;these newly discovered giants are largely mysterious. From what Jill Banfield of the University of California has been able to tell, though, these giants defy some fundamental ideas about how viruses usually work. <br \/><br \/>Giant phages seem to exert more control over their bacterial hosts than a typical virus. All viruses co-opt their hosts&rsquo; resources to build more copies of themselves, but the huge phages seem to carry out &ldquo;a much more thorough and directed takeover,&rdquo; Banfield says. Their target is the ribosome&mdash;a manufacturing plant found in all living cells, which reads the information encoded in genes and uses that to build proteins. The huge phages seem equipped to fully commandeer the ribosome so that it ignores the host&rsquo;s genes, and instead devotes itself to building viral proteins. <br \/><br \/>This takeover involves an unorthodox use of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats). Long before humans discovered CRISPR and used it to edit DNA, bacteria invented it as a way of defending themselves against viruses. The bacteria store genetic snippets of phages that have previously attacked them, and use these to send destructive scissor like enzymes after new waves of assailants. But Banfield&rsquo;s team found that some huge phages have their own versions of CRISPR, which they use in two ways. First, they direct their own scissors at bacterial genes, which partly explains why they can so thoroughly take over the ribosomes of their hosts. Second, they seem to redirect the&nbsp;bacterial&nbsp;scissors into attacking&nbsp;other phages. They actually boost their hosts&rsquo; immune system to take out the competition. <br \/><br \/>All these behaviours are intriguing because they complicate the&nbsp;already heated debate&nbsp;about whether viruses should count as living things. Viruses share the same genetic material&mdash;DNA and RNA&mdash;that&rsquo;s used in living cells, but cannot reproduce on their own and are completely dependent on their hosts. But in the complexity of their genomes, the giant phages certainly dwarf many organisms that are clearly alive&mdash;including bacteria that are also sometimes dependent on hosts for proliferation. <br \/><br \/>There are several reasons to find out more about these large viruses. For a start, phages have medical uses. In recent years, doctors have repeatedly used phages to treat bacterial infections that resisted all conventional antibiotics and seemed incurable. Intensive research on phages founded the field of modern molecular biology. Much of what we know about how genes work, and many technologies for altering and cloning said genes, came about through studying a phage called lambda. <br \/><br \/>Future potential aside, the huge phages are almost certainly affecting us already. Phages control the communities of bacteria living in our bodies. They might defend us against dangerous microbes, or they could spread genes for resisting antibiotics among those microbes.

Choose the best answer for each question.<\/strong> <br \/><br \/>Your mouth is currently teeming with giant viruses that, until very recently, no one knew existed. Unlike Ebola or the new coronavirus that&rsquo;s currently making headlines, these particular viruses don&rsquo;t cause disease in humans. They&rsquo;re part of a group known as phages, which infect and kill bacteria. But while many phages are well studied,&nbsp;these newly discovered giants are largely mysterious. From what Jill Banfield of the University of California has been able to tell, though, these giants defy some fundamental ideas about how viruses usually work. <br \/><br \/>Giant phages seem to exert more control over their bacterial hosts than a typical virus. All viruses co-opt their hosts&rsquo; resources to build more copies of themselves, but the huge phages seem to carry out &ldquo;a much more thorough and directed takeover,&rdquo; Banfield says. Their target is the ribosome&mdash;a manufacturing plant found in all living cells, which reads the information encoded in genes and uses that to build proteins. The huge phages seem equipped to fully commandeer the ribosome so that it ignores the host&rsquo;s genes, and instead devotes itself to building viral proteins. <br \/><br \/>This takeover involves an unorthodox use of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats). Long before humans discovered CRISPR and used it to edit DNA, bacteria invented it as a way of defending themselves against viruses. The bacteria store genetic snippets of phages that have previously attacked them, and use these to send destructive scissor like enzymes after new waves of assailants. But Banfield&rsquo;s team found that some huge phages have their own versions of CRISPR, which they use in two ways. First, they direct their own scissors at bacterial genes, which partly explains why they can so thoroughly take over the ribosomes of their hosts. Second, they seem to redirect the&nbsp;bacterial&nbsp;scissors into attacking&nbsp;other phages. They actually boost their hosts&rsquo; immune system to take out the competition. <br \/><br \/>All these behaviours are intriguing because they complicate the&nbsp;already heated debate&nbsp;about whether viruses should count as living things. Viruses share the same genetic material&mdash;DNA and RNA&mdash;that&rsquo;s used in living cells, but cannot reproduce on their own and are completely dependent on their hosts. But in the complexity of their genomes, the giant phages certainly dwarf many organisms that are clearly alive&mdash;including bacteria that are also sometimes dependent on hosts for proliferation. <br \/><br \/>There are several reasons to find out more about these large viruses. For a start, phages have medical uses. In recent years, doctors have repeatedly used phages to treat bacterial infections that resisted all conventional antibiotics and seemed incurable. Intensive research on phages founded the field of modern molecular biology. Much of what we know about how genes work, and many technologies for altering and cloning said genes, came about through studying a phage called lambda. <br \/><br \/>Future potential aside, the huge phages are almost certainly affecting us already. Phages control the communities of bacteria living in our bodies. They might defend us against dangerous microbes, or they could spread genes for resisting antibiotics among those microbes. Good or bad, parasite or mutualist, animate or inanimate: Phages seem to resist any possible classification (521 words).<\/p>","PassageTitle":"q1","IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<span>Refer to the last two paragraphs: \u201c\u2026 In recent years, doctors have<\/span><span><\/span><span>repeatedly used phages to treat bacterial infections<\/span><span><\/span><span>that resisted all conventional antibiotics and seemed incurable \u2026&nbsp;<\/span><span>Future potential aside \u2026 Phages<\/span><span><\/span><span>control the communities of bacteria<\/span><span><\/span><span>living in our bodies.

If we could find the origins of racial classification, then we would know for certain that racism is not an inevitable aspect of social life. If it turns out that &lsquo;race&rsquo; is a modern invention, then dismantling certain modern institutions would help fight racism. If &lsquo;race&rsquo; is not modern, such an approach might be misguided, and we should explore how racialization works over the longue dur&eacute;e. Either way, it is crucial that we locate where the idea of &lsquo;race&rsquo; comes from. Is &lsquo;race&rsquo; modern?<br \/><br \/>Race theorists have long disagreed about how to answer that question. This is not, however, because of disagreement about the historical facts. Somewhat the debate remains unresolved mainly because the question itself is ambiguous. When race scholars ask whether or not race is modern, they end up answering different questions. By unbraiding these, we can better understand the history of &lsquo;race&rsquo; and racialisation.<br \/><br \/>One of those questions is whether the concept of race is modern. The term appears in translations of ancient texts, which makes it seem as though the Ancients had some concept of race: one can find, for example, the term &lsquo;race&rsquo; in translations of Hesiod&rsquo;s genealogical poem Theogony, written around 700 BCE. The term that is translated into &lsquo;race&rsquo; is &lsquo;genos&rsquo;, which is hardly an ancient Greek word for &lsquo;race&rsquo;. Consider Hesiod&rsquo;s discussion of &lsquo;genos gynaikon&rsquo; &ndash; the &lsquo;race&rsquo; of women. &lsquo;Races&rsquo; are supposed to be composed of individuals who tend to procreate with each other. Ancient Greeks meant something very different from &lsquo;genos&rsquo; than we moderns mean by &lsquo;race&rsquo;.<br \/><br \/>So we must be careful not to project our concepts onto the Ancients. The idea of race likely would have made little sense to them. According to the physician and medical theorist Hippocrates, a new-born baby&rsquo;s skin colour was determined by the climate, not by the physical characteristics of the parents. Ancient Greek theories about pigmentation emphasised how the environment affects the body. They were mostly antithetical to later &ndash; explicitly racial &ndash; theories, according to which the body is impervious to the environment.<br \/><br \/>Most race theorists who believe that there was a pre-modern concept of race focus not on antiquity, but rather on the Middle Ages, particularly 15th-century Spain. (Following the convention in this debate, I date the onset of modernity at 1492.) The significance of this period and place in the history of the race has to do with changing attitudes toward two things: blood and holy water.<br \/><br \/>Christianity is, of course, a proselytising religion, and it has long accepted converts into the faith. However, in 15th-century Spain, the potency of baptismal waters was seriously questioned. According to the &lsquo;Purity of Blood&rsquo; statutes, Jews and Moors could no longer convert to Christianity, and the conversos were stripped of their positions and privileges. The Jews and the Moors were deemed to be unalterable razas or races, and no amount of baptismal water could change this.

Today, far fewer people are likely to catch the scriptural echoes of this question than would have been the case 50 years ago. However, the question retains its urgency. We might not quite know what we mean by the soul any more, but intuitively we grasp what is meant by the loss in question \u2013 the kind of moral disorientation and collapse where what is right and good slips from sight, and we find we have wasted our lives on some specious gain that is ultimately worthless.<br><br>It used to be thought that science and technology would gain us the world. Nevertheless, it now looks as though they are allowing us to destroy it. The fault lies not with scientific knowledge itself, which is among humanity\u2019s most exceptional achievements, but with our greed and short-sightedness in exploiting that knowledge. There is a real danger we might end up with the worst of all possible scenarios \u2013 we have lost the world, and lost our souls as well.<br><br>However, what is the soul? The modern scientific impulse is to dispense with supposedly occult or \u2018spooky\u2019 notions such as souls and spirits, and to understand ourselves instead as wholly and completely part of the natural world, existing and operating through the same physical, chemical and biological processes that we find anywhere else in the environment.<br><br>We need not deny the value of the scientific perspective. However, there are many aspects of human experience that cannot adequately be captured in the impersonal, quantitatively based terminology of scientific enquiry. The concept of the soul might not be part of the language of science; but we immediately recognise and respond to what is meant in poetry, novels and ordinary speech, when the term \u2018soul\u2019 is used in that it alerts us to certain powerful and transformative experiences that give meaning to our lives. Such experiences include the joy that arises from loving another human being or the exaltation when we surrender to the beauty of a great artistic or musical work. <br><br>Such precious experiences depend on certain characteristic human sensibilities that we would not wish to lose at any price. In using the term \u2018soul\u2019 to refer to them, we do not have to think of ourselves as ghostly immaterial substances. We can think of \u2018soul\u2019 as referring, instead, to a set of attributes \u00ad\u00ad\u2013 of cognition, feeling and reflective awareness \u2013 that might depend on the biological processes that underpin them, and yet enable us to enter a world of meaning and value that transcends our biological nature.<br><br>Entering this world requires distinctively human qualities of thought and rationality. However, we are not abstract intellects, detached from the physical world, contemplating it and manipulating it from a distance. To realise what makes us most fully human, we need to pay attention to the richness and depth of the emotional responses that connect us to the world.
