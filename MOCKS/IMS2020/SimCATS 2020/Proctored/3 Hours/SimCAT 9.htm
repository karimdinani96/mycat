The indigo insect was last spotted in central Florida in 2016, five years after it was first identified. However, this spring, just as Americans began to hunker down because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the rare blue bees, known scientifically as Osmia calaminthae, were rediscovered in the same region foraging on Ashe's calamint, a dainty violet flower that blooms in specific scrub habitats.<br \/><br \/>Chase Kimmel of the Florida Museum of Natural History confirmed the bees' survival in March. At first, he could not believe his own eyes. \"It was a great feeling; those first few nights were hard to sleep due to the anxiousness and excitement,\" he says. \"The first few times I found the bee I could not help [but] constantly question my own eyes and judgment on the diagnostic characteristics of the bee. I needed to look multiple times at the photos to confirm their identity.\"<br \/><br \/>In all, Kimmel and colleagues documented just 17 rare bees and never more than three at any one time. To find these few, and record them for potential legal protections, Kimmel ventured to different sites across the Lake Wales Sand Ridge, a 150-mile long region along the dirt roads of central Florida marked by sprawling citrus groves and Bok's Singing Tower, a 205-foot iridescent neo-Gothic structure. It is a place where the jasmine-like scent of orange blossoms hangs thick in the air.<br \/><br \/>\"The Lake Wales Ridge is a pretty specialised environment composed of a scrub habitat that is limited in geographic extent,\" Kimmel says. The flower that hosts the bee is restricted to a few of these isolated scrub pockets, predominantly along the ridge, Kimmel says, meaning the bee has probably always been restricted to a small area.<br \/><br \/>In addition to this geographic limitation, experts believe habitat loss and fragmentation have hurt the blue bee's numbers in recent decades. \"This ancient island ridge is now primarily composed of agriculture, typically citrus, and urban development,\" Kimmel says. \"While we have no evidence of pesticide exposure, it is highly likely that this adjacent agriculture could impact the bees given that they have been found only meters away.\"<br \/><br \/>Because blue calamintha bees have been known for only a decade, scientists are still getting to know more about their vulnerabilities and idiosyncrasies. For example, the bees appear to have an unusual way of foraging. They tend to rapidly bob their heads two to four times when visiting flowers. Kimmel and other experts believe they do this to dislodge pollen from the plant, but none of the other 23 bee species known to visit Ashe's calamint does this, Kimmel says.<br \/><br \/>\"This behaviour also results in some of the bees carrying pollen on their face for extended periods, which is also rare,\" he says. \"It is quite strange that it does not groom itself more often and transfer the pollen to its abdomen sooner. The hairs on its face appear modified for collecting pollen, but this would need additional studies to see if that is the case.\"<\/p>","PassageTitle":"q5-9","IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">Th<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">e third paragraph states that \u201c\u2026&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Kimmel and colleagues documented just 17 rare bees and never more than three at any one time.

G&ouml;bekli Tepe, a roughly 11,500-year-old complex in southeastern Turkey, is the world's oldest temple. Now, new research suggests it may also be one of the earliest examples of geometrically planned architecture. Located in southeastern Anatolia, G&ouml;bekli Tepe's circles of T-shaped, limestone megaliths resemble a more intricate, less rough-hewn iteration of Stonehenge, which it predates by some 6,000 years. Neolithic hunter-gatherers likely constructed the temple, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. Many of the site's imposing stones feature etchings of foxes, lions, scorpions and vultures.

However, its architectural complexity is highly unusual for them.\" When experts first studied G&ouml;bekli Tepe in the 1960s, they dismissed it as a medieval cemetery. However, in 1994, German archaeologist Klaus Schmidt revealed the sprawling complex's true age, sparking an intense debate over its origins that continues to this day.<br \/><br \/>Per Encyclopedia Britannica, researchers had long thought that the development of complex social systems like religion only emerged after humans settled down and started making forays into agriculture. However, G&ouml;bekli Tepe's age&mdash;and a lack of evidence that farming or animal domestication occurred nearby&mdash;suggests the coordinated efforts required to build it may have instigated settlement rather than followed it. Much of the site has yet to be excavated. Surveys suggest some 15 additional rings of huge stones remain buried beneath the soil, reports Yasemin Saplakoglu for Live Science. One of the outstanding questions surrounding the ancient site is whether its structures were built simultaneously or one at a time.

However, instead of writing, he spent that year pursuing other projects, entertaining guests, and delaying his work. Frustrated, Hugo\u2019s publisher responded by setting a deadline less than six months away. The book had to be finished by February 1831.<br><br>Hugo concocted a strange plan to beat his procrastination. He collected all of his clothes and asked an assistant to lock them away in a large chest. He was left with nothing to wear except a large shawl. Lacking any suitable clothing to go outdoors, he remained in his study and wrote furiously during the fall and winter of 1830. The Hunchback of Notre Dame was published two weeks early on January 14, 1831.<br><br>Human beings have been procrastinating for centuries. Even prolific artists like Victor Hugo are not immune to the distractions of daily life. The problem is so timeless that ancient Greek philosophers like Socrates and Aristotle developed a word to describe this type of behaviour: Akrasia.<br><br>Akrasia is the state of acting against your better judgment. It is when you do one thing even though you know you should do something else. Loosely translated, you could say that Akrasia is procrastination or a lack of self-control. Akrasia is what prevents you from following through on what you set out to do.<br><br>Why would Victor Hugo commit to writing a book and then put it off for over a year? Why do we make plans, set deadlines, and commit to goals, but then fail to follow through on them? One explanation for why Akrasia rules our lives and procrastination pulls us in has to do with a  behavioural economics term called \u201ctime inconsistency.\u201d Time inconsistency refers to the tendency of the human brain to value immediate rewards more highly than future rewards.<br><br>When you make plans for yourself \u2014 like setting a goal to lose weight or write a book or learn a language \u2014 you are making plans for your future self. You are envisioning what you want your life to be like in the future, and when you think about the future, it is easy for your brain to see the value in taking actions with long-term benefits.<br><br>When the time comes to make a decision, however, you are no longer choosing your future self. Now you are in the moment, and your brain is thinking about the present self. Furthermore, researchers have discovered that the present self likes instant gratification, not long-term payoff. This is one reason why you might go to bed feeling motivated to make a change in your life, but when you wake up, you find yourself falling into old patterns.
