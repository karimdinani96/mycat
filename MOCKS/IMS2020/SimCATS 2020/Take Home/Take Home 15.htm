Senescence is not a single process but is manifested in an increased susceptibility to many diseases and a decreasing ability to repair damage. Death rates in modern developed countries are very low at age 10 to 12, about 0.2 per 1000 children per year. The death rate increases slowly to 1.35 per 1000 at age 30, then increases exponentially, doubling every 8 years. By age 90, the death rate is 169 per 1000.

Choose the most appropriate answer to each question.<\/strong><br \/><br \/><br \/>Populists abhor restraints on the political executive. Since they claim to represent \u201cthe people\u201d writ large, they regard limits on their exercise of power as necessarily undermining the popular will. Such constraints can only serve the \u201cenemies of the people\u201d \u2013 minorities and foreigners or financial elites. This is a dangerous approach to politics, because it allows a majority to ride roughshod over the rights of minorities. Without separation of powers, an independent judiciary, or free media \u2013 which all populist autocrats, from Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan to Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Donald Trump detest \u2013 democracy degenerates into the tyranny of whoever happens to be in power.<br \/><br \/>Periodic elections under populist rule become a smokescreen. In the absence of the rule of law and basic civil liberties, populist regimes can prolong their rule by manipulating the media and the judiciary at will. Populists\u2019 aversion to institutional restraints extends to the economy, where exercising full control \u201cin the people\u2019s interest\u201d implies that no obstacles should be placed in their way by autonomous regulatory agencies, independent central banks, or global trade rules. Start with why restraints on economic policy may be desirable in the first place. Economists tend to have a soft spot for such restraints, because policymaking that is fully responsive to the push and pull of domestic politics can generate highly inefficient outcomes. In particular, economic policy is often subject to the problem of what economists call time-inconsistency: short-term interests frequently undermine the pursuit of policies that are far more desirable in the long term.<\/p><p><br \/>A canonical example is discretionary monetary policy. Politicians who have the power to print money at will may generate \u201csurprise inflation\u201d to boost output and employment in the short run \u2013 say, before an election. But this backfires, because firms and households adjust their inflation expectations. In the end, discretionary monetary policy results only in higher inflation without yielding any output or employment gains. The solution is an independent central bank, insulated from politics, operating solely on its mandate to maintain price stability.Another example is official treatment of foreign investors. Once a foreign firm makes its investment, it essentially becomes captive to the host government\u2019s whims. Promises that were made to attract the firm are easily forgotten, replaced by policies that squeeze it to the benefit of the national budget or domestic companies. But there are other scenarios as well, in which the consequences of restraints on economic policy may be less salutary. In particular, restraints may be instituted by special interests or elites themselves, to cement permanent control over policymaking. In such cases, delegation to autonomous agencies or signing on to global rules does not serve society, but only a narrow caste of \u201cinsiders.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Part of today\u2019s populist backlash is rooted in the belief, not entirely unjustified, that this scenario describes much economic policymaking in recent decades. Multinational corporations and investors have increasingly shaped the agenda of international trade negotiations, resulting in global regimes that disproportionately benefit capital at the expense of labor. Stringent patent rules and international investor tribunals are prime examples. So is the capture of autonomous agencies by the industries they are supposed to regulate. Banks and other financial institutions have been especially successful at getting their way and instituting rules that give them free rein. Independent central banks played a critical role in bringing inflation down in the 1980s and 1990s. But in the current low-inflation environment, their exclusive focus on price stability imparts a deflationary bias to economic policy and is in tension with employment generation and growth.<br \/><br \/>Such \u201cliberal technocracy\u201d may be at its apogee in the European Union, where economic rules and regulations are designed at considerable remove from democratic deliberation at the national level. And in virtually every member state, this political gap \u2013 the EU\u2019s so-called democratic deficit \u2013 has given rise to populist, Euro skeptical political parties. In such cases, relaxing the constraints on economic policy and returning policymaking autonomy to elected governments may well be desirable. We should constantly be wary of populism that stifles political pluralism and undermines liberal democratic norms. Political populism is a menace to be avoided at all costs. Economic populism, by contrast, is occasionally necessary.

Since they claim to represent \u201cthe people\u201d writ large, they regard limits on their exercise of power as necessarily undermining the popular will. Such constraints can only serve the \u201cenemies of the people\u201d \u2013 minorities and foreigners or financial elites. This is a dangerous approach to politics, because it allows a majority to ride roughshod over the rights of minorities. Without separation of powers, an independent judiciary, or free media \u2013 which all populist autocrats, from Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan to Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Donald Trump detest \u2013 democracy degenerates into the tyranny of whoever happens to be in power.<br \/><br \/>Periodic elections under populist rule become a smokescreen. In the absence of the rule of law and basic civil liberties, populist regimes can prolong their rule by manipulating the media and the judiciary at will. Populists\u2019 aversion to institutional restraints extends to the economy, where exercising full control \u201cin the people\u2019s interest\u201d implies that no obstacles should be placed in their way by autonomous regulatory agencies, independent central banks, or global trade rules. Start with why restraints on economic policy may be desirable in the first place. Economists tend to have a soft spot for such restraints, because policymaking that is fully responsive to the push and pull of domestic politics can generate highly inefficient outcomes. In particular, economic policy is often subject to the problem of what economists call time-inconsistency: short-term interests frequently undermine the pursuit of policies that are far more desirable in the long term.<\/p><p><br \/>A canonical example is discretionary monetary policy. Politicians who have the power to print money at will may generate \u201csurprise inflation\u201d to boost output and employment in the short run \u2013 say, before an election. But this backfires, because firms and households adjust their inflation expectations. In the end, discretionary monetary policy results only in higher inflation without yielding any output or employment gains. The solution is an independent central bank, insulated from politics, operating solely on its mandate to maintain price stability.Another example is official treatment of foreign investors. Once a foreign firm makes its investment, it essentially becomes captive to the host government\u2019s whims. Promises that were made to attract the firm are easily forgotten, replaced by policies that squeeze it to the benefit of the national budget or domestic companies. But there are other scenarios as well, in which the consequences of restraints on economic policy may be less salutary. In particular, restraints may be instituted by special interests or elites themselves, to cement permanent control over policymaking. In such cases, delegation to autonomous agencies or signing on to global rules does not serve society, but only a narrow caste of \u201cinsiders.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Part of today\u2019s populist backlash is rooted in the belief, not entirely unjustified, that this scenario describes much economic policymaking in recent decades. Multinational corporations and investors have increasingly shaped the agenda of international trade negotiations, resulting in global regimes that disproportionately benefit capital at the expense of labor. Stringent patent rules and international investor tribunals are prime examples. So is the capture of autonomous agencies by the industries they are supposed to regulate. Banks and other financial institutions have been especially successful at getting their way and instituting rules that give them free rein.

Choose the most appropriate answer to each question.<\/strong><br \/><br \/><br \/>Populists abhor restraints on the political executive. Since they claim to represent \u201cthe people\u201d writ large, they regard limits on their exercise of power as necessarily undermining the popular will. Such constraints can only serve the \u201cenemies of the people\u201d \u2013 minorities and foreigners or financial elites. This is a dangerous approach to politics, because it allows a majority to ride roughshod over the rights of minorities. Without separation of powers, an independent judiciary, or free media \u2013 which all populist autocrats, from Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan to Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Donald Trump detest \u2013 democracy degenerates into the tyranny of whoever happens to be in power.<br \/><br \/>Periodic elections under populist rule become a smokescreen. In the absence of the rule of law and basic civil liberties, populist regimes can prolong their rule by manipulating the media and the judiciary at will. Populists\u2019 aversion to institutional restraints extends to the economy, where exercising full control \u201cin the people\u2019s interest\u201d implies that no obstacles should be placed in their way by autonomous regulatory agencies, independent central banks, or global trade rules. Start with why restraints on economic policy may be desirable in the first place. Economists tend to have a soft spot for such restraints, because policymaking that is fully responsive to the push and pull of domestic politics can generate highly inefficient outcomes. In particular, economic policy is often subject to the problem of what economists call time-inconsistency: short-term interests frequently undermine the pursuit of policies that are far more desirable in the long term.<\/p><p><br \/>A canonical example is discretionary monetary policy. Politicians who have the power to print money at will may generate \u201csurprise inflation\u201d to boost output and employment in the short run \u2013 say, before an election. But this backfires, because firms and households adjust their inflation expectations. In the end, discretionary monetary policy results only in higher inflation without yielding any output or employment gains. The solution is an independent central bank, insulated from politics, operating solely on its mandate to maintain price stability.Another example is official treatment of foreign investors. Once a foreign firm makes its investment, it essentially becomes captive to the host government\u2019s whims. Promises that were made to attract the firm are easily forgotten, replaced by policies that squeeze it to the benefit of the national budget or domestic companies. But there are other scenarios as well, in which the consequences of restraints on economic policy may be less salutary. In particular, restraints may be instituted by special interests or elites themselves, to cement permanent control over policymaking. In such cases, delegation to autonomous agencies or signing on to global rules does not serve society, but only a narrow caste of \u201cinsiders.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Part of today\u2019s populist backlash is rooted in the belief, not entirely unjustified, that this scenario describes much economic policymaking in recent decades. Multinational corporations and investors have increasingly shaped the agenda of international trade negotiations, resulting in global regimes that disproportionately benefit capital at the expense of labor. Stringent patent rules and international investor tribunals are prime examples. So is the capture of autonomous agencies by the industries they are supposed to regulate. Banks and other financial institutions have been especially successful at getting their way and instituting rules that give them free rein. Independent central banks played a critical role in bringing inflation down in the 1980s and 1990s. But in the current low-inflation environment, their exclusive focus on price stability imparts a deflationary bias to economic policy and is in tension with employment generation and growth.<br \/><br \/>Such \u201cliberal technocracy\u201d may be at its apogee in the European Union, where economic rules and regulations are designed at considerable remove from democratic deliberation at the national level. And in virtually every member state, this political gap \u2013 the EU\u2019s so-called democratic deficit \u2013 has given rise to populist, Euro skeptical political parties. In such cases, relaxing the constraints on economic policy and returning policymaking autonomy to elected governments may well be desirable. We should constantly be wary of populism that stifles political pluralism and undermines liberal democratic norms. Political populism is a menace to be avoided at all costs. Economic populism, by contrast, is occasionally necessary. Indeed, at such times, it may be the only way to forestall its much more dangerous political cousin.<\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":false,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<p>This question is of medium difficulty. <br \/><span>Option 1 is incorrect.

The technocracy thus includes the independent central banks. However, the passage expands the scope of this technocracy prior to that.

The QA section of NAT-2018 had 34 questions, all of which\u00a0were multiple choice format questions. The following was the marking scheme for NAT-2018:<br \/><br \/> 1. Each correct answer fetched 12 marks. There was negative marking for incorrect answers. For each incorrect answer, four marks were deducted from the score of a student.\u00a0<br \/><br \/> 2. Additionally, there was a progressive penalty for skipped questions, as specified in the table below:<br \/><br \/> <img style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" src=\"http:\/\/imsclick2cert.blob.core.windows.net\/imsitemimages\/docximg_1531287789_image6.png\" alt=\"\" data-docx-image=\"image6.png\" \/><br \/><br \/> For example, a student who skipped 6 questions lost 0 \u00d7 4 + 1 \u00d7 (6 \u2013 4) = 2 marks on account of these 6 skipped questions. Similarly, a student who skipped 18 questions lost 0 \u00d7 4 + 1 \u00d7 4 + 2 \u00d7 4 + 3 \u00d7 4 + 4 \u00d7 2 = 32 marks on account of these 18 skipped questions.<br \/><br \/> 3. The exam is computerized and the questions are presented to students one at a time. Once a student sees the question, he\/she has only two options before seeing the next question: either attempt the question or skip the question. After a student attempts\/skips a question, the next question is presented and he\/she is not able to revisit the questions that are already attempted\/skipped.\u00a0<br \/><br \/> 4. All the questions that a student is unable to answer in the stipulated time of one hour are considered to be \u2018skipped\u2019 by the student.
