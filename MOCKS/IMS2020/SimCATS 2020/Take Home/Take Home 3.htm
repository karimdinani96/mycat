Choose the best answer for each question.<\/b>\r<br>\r<br>When a \u201csolution\u201d to a problem causes more damage than the problem, policymaking has gone awry. That\u2019s where we often find ourselves with global warming today. Activist organizations like Worldwatch argue that higher temperatures will make more people hungry, so drastic carbon cuts are needed. But a comprehensive new study led by researchers from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis has found that strong global climate action would cause far more hunger and food insecurity than climate change itself. The scientists used eight global-agricultural models to analyze various scenarios between now and 2050. These models suggest, on average, that climate change could put an extra 24 million people at risk of hunger. But a global carbon tax would increase food prices and push 78 million more people into risk of hunger. The areas expected to be most vulnerable are sub-Saharan Africa and India. Trying to help 24 million people by imperiling 78 million people\u2019s lives is a very poor policy.\r<br>\r<br>If we want to eradicate hunger, there are more effective ways. Around 800 million people are undernourished today, mostly because of poverty. The single most significant initiative that could be undertaken is not a policy that slows the global economy, but one that cuts poverty: a global trade deal. The Doha free-trade deal was allowed to collapse with just a fraction of the attention given to global climate-change negotiations. Reviving Doha would lift an extra 145 million people out of poverty by 2030, according to research commissioned by Copenhagen Consensus. Meanwhile, the flawed Paris agreement, which is the closest we have to a global scheme, will achieve at best merely 1 percent of what would be needed to keep temperature rises under 2\u00b0C, according to the UN. It\u2019ll cost $1 trillion to $2 trillion annually. This is money that can\u2019t be spent improving nutrition, health or education.\r<br>\r<br>When comparing the massive cost with the slight delay in climate damage, each dollar spent delivers just three cents of climate benefits \u2014 i.e., lower hurricane damage, fewer heat waves, less agricultural stress. Forcing poor countries to reduce emissions does even more harm, because cheap, abundant energy brings prosperity. Aside from the immorality of obliging poor nations to avoid policies that would reduce poverty, the big problem with forcing carbon cuts is that green energy is not yet the savior that it is portrayed as. Even after decades of heavy investment in subsidies to support green-energy production \u2014 costing more than $150 billion just this year \u2014 the International Energy Agency finds that wind provides just 0.6 percent of energy needs, and solar 0.2 percent. By 2040, even if all of the grand promises in the Paris agreement on climate change were to be fulfilled, the IEA finds these figures will inch up to just 2.1 percent and 1.5 percent.\r<br>\r<br>We need to get smarter about climate change.

The Paris agreement and Doha deal are examples of the larger point made by the author. The larger point being the inefficiency of the current policies and \u201csolutions\u201d towards fighting climate change, along with theadverse economic consequences caused while they try to do so. Hence, \u201csmarter\u201d approaches are needed to tackle the problem, according to the author. The Doha deal is invoked to point out that a trade deal will address the hunger issue better than\u00a0the\u00a0Paris climate deal. Thus, option 1 does not reflect the primary purpose of the passage. Eliminate option 1. <br \/> <br \/>Option 2 is incorrect. The author never disputes the reliability of\u00a0the\u00a0climate-change claims. The author\u2019s point is that the current solutions to the climate-change problem are\u00a0only\u00a0stalling prosperity and thereby worsening the climate-change problem. Eliminate option 2. <br \/> <br \/>Option 3 is correct. Paragraph 1\u00a0states thus: \u201cWhen a \u2018solution\u2019 to a problem causes more damage than the problem, policymaking has gone awry. That\u2019s where we often find ourselves with global warming today.\u201d Then the author lists the drawbacks of the current approach to global warming and provides more effective alternatives to tackle it. Finally, the author ends the essay\u00a0thus:\u00a0 \u201cwe need to get smarter about climate change. A survey of 27 top climate economists concluded that the best long-term investment is in green energy R&D. For every dollar spent, $11 of climate damages would be avoided. That makes much more sense than today\u2019s climate approach, which mostly does more harm than good.\u201d Thus, we can conclude that the primary purpose of the author is to criticize the current methods and suggest alternatives to fight climate change more efficiently.\u00a0Retain option 3. <br \/> <br \/>Option 4 is incorrect. The author does not challenge the claim that global warming is the most pressing environmental issue we are facing.

Choose the best answer for each question.<\/b><\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Welcome to India\u2019s extraordinary media environment, in which the Fourth Estate serves as witness, prosecutor, judge, jury, and executioner. With far too many channels competing 24\/7 for the same sets of eyeballs and target rating points (TRPs), television news has long since abandoned any pretense of providing a public service, and instead blatantly privileges sensation over substance. Indian TV epitomizes the old crack about why television is called a medium: because it is neither rare nor well done.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">When it comes to print media, the situation is not much better. Newspapers are now competing in a fast-changing and overcrowded media landscape where it is not they, but TV, that sets the pace: every morning, they must reach readers who have watched TV the previous day. So, instead of providing context, depth, and analysis, newspapers are blasting out headlines that stimulate prurience or outrage.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">The result has been disturbing, to put it mildly. The airing of opinions is the cheapest way to fill a broadcast hour; ranting anchors score the highest TRPs. This reinforces the motivation to engage in sensational speculation, however baseless.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">More fundamentally, the rush to beat TV by breaking stories has weakened journalists\u2019 incentive to perform due diligence, in terms of researching stories and verifying claims. This erosion of professional standards has too often made newspapers willing accomplices of purveyors of manipulated \u201cleaks\u201d and malicious allegations. The distinctions among fact, opinion, and speculation, between reportage and rumor, and between sourced information and unfounded claims \u2013 which are drummed into journalism students\u2019 heads the world over \u2013 have faded into irrelevance in today\u2019s Indian media.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">The cavalier attitude toward facts is compounded by extreme reluctance to issue corrections. So a blaze of lurid and unverified headlines does untold damage. When corrections are offered, they are too feeble and come too late to restore innocent people\u2019s reputations.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Unsurprisingly, trust in Indian media is eroding. The free press is both the mortar that holds in place the bricks of our country\u2019s freedom, and the open window embedded in those bricks.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">The news media are supposed to enable a free citizenry to make informed choices about who governs them and how. And, by looking critically at elected officials\u2019 actions (or inaction), they are supposed to ensure that those who govern remain accountable to those who put them there.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Instead, Indian media <\/span>today report recklessly on ephemera that have no impact on public welfare, and focus constantly on the superficial and the sensational. In doing so, they trivialize public discourse and abdicate their responsibilities as facilitators and protectors of democracy. Far from a call for controls on the free press \u2013 no Indian democrat would issue such a call \u2013 this is a demand for better journalism.<br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Government needs a free and professional media to keep it honest and efficient, to serve as both mirror and scalpel. A blunt axe serves no society well. If India wishes to be taken seriously as a responsible global player and a model twenty-first-century democracy, we must take ourselves seriously and behave responsibly. Our journalism, a face of India that others see and by which \u2013 fairly or not \u2013 we are judged, would be a good place to start.<\/span>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">This<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> is an easy question.<\/span> <br \/> <br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The last paragraph recommends the kind of media that would serve the interests of the country.

Choose the best answer for each question.<\/b><br>\t<br>The Earth\u2019s magnetic field is a mysterious thing. What is magnetism? As a child, I used to push together the north poles of two toy magnets, and remember even now how frustratingly difficult it was to make them touch \u2013 or how tricky it was to prevent the north and south poles from locking together when I tried to keep them just a tiny bit apart. A few years later, I looked on, impressed but with incomprehension, as a physics teacher sprinkled iron filings around a magnet, to show how they lined up along the invisible lines of force. But what were these lines? \u2013 and why in that particular shape? It\u2019s still something I don\u2019t have any visceral understanding of, any more than I can explain how the innards of this computer produce letters on the screen when I press the keys. It is something that just is.<br><br>The ancients were equally puzzled (though with more reason to be). The magnetic properties of lodestone (the iron mineral magnetite) had been discovered by the Chinese over 2000 years ago, and they went on to invent the compass, by placing a spoon made of lodestone on a smooth board. It took a thousand more years for knowledge of this phenomenon to be appreciated in Europe, when it was observed that a lodestone needle pointed towards the pole star, the only fixed star in the sky, and that was naturally taken as the source of the magnetism (although there was an appealing counter-idea that there were mountains made of lodestone at the North Pole).<br><br>Then came the discovery of magnetic declination: that the compass needle did not point to true north, but a little way away, to magnetic north; and of magnetic inclination, that the needle also pointed downwards towards the pole (not at all at the equator, but vertically downwards at the pole \u2013 where compasses are useless for that reason). William Gilbert in 1600 first understood what this meant, by experimenting with how a sphere of lodestone (representing the Earth) affected a lodestone needle moved across its surface. He realized that it was not a star, nor magnetic mountains, but the whole Earth that acted as a magnet.<br><br>And now it is known (though this is something that I cannot truly fathom either) that the magnetic field is the product of the Earth\u2019s molten core (which has, though, a solid centre). It is the electric eddy currents in the slowly swirling molten iron-nickel outer core, allied to the Earth\u2019s spin around its axis, which produces the Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Looked at more closely, the Earth\u2019s magnetic field is a mobile, dynamic thing: the Earth\u2019s spin keeps it aligned roughly north\u2013south but in detail the magnetic north and south poles are never stable but move across the Earth\u2019s surface by ten kilometres a year or more, to produce the constantly varying declination.<br><br>\tThe field also flips every so often, north becoming south and south becoming north \u2013 lately it has been doing so every few hundred thousand years, though at some times it has remained locked into a single mode for tens of millions of years. <br><br>Without a magnetic field, there would be no shield to protect the Earth from the cosmic radiation of the solar wind, that would otherwise have shattered any proto life-forms that emerged on this planet, and for good measure stripped away most of the atmosphere and oceans \u2013 as probably happened with Venus and Mars, both of which lack a magnetic field.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<p><span>This<\/span><span> is an easy question.<\/span> <br \/> <br \/><span>Option [1] is incorrect.

Choose the best answer for each question.<\/b><br>\t<br>The Earth\u2019s magnetic field is a mysterious thing. What is magnetism? As a child, I used to push together the north poles of two toy magnets, and remember even now how frustratingly difficult it was to make them touch \u2013 or how tricky it was to prevent the north and south poles from locking together when I tried to keep them just a tiny bit apart. A few years later, I looked on, impressed but with incomprehension, as a physics teacher sprinkled iron filings around a magnet, to show how they lined up along the invisible lines of force. But what were these lines? \u2013 and why in that particular shape? It\u2019s still something I don\u2019t have any visceral understanding of, any more than I can explain how the innards of this computer produce letters on the screen when I press the keys. It is something that just is.<br><br>The ancients were equally puzzled (though with more reason to be). The magnetic properties of lodestone (the iron mineral magnetite) had been discovered by the Chinese over 2000 years ago, and they went on to invent the compass, by placing a spoon made of lodestone on a smooth board. It took a thousand more years for knowledge of this phenomenon to be appreciated in Europe, when it was observed that a lodestone needle pointed towards the pole star, the only fixed star in the sky, and that was naturally taken as the source of the magnetism (although there was an appealing counter-idea that there were mountains made of lodestone at the North Pole).<br><br>Then came the discovery of magnetic declination: that the compass needle did not point to true north, but a little way away, to magnetic north; and of magnetic inclination, that the needle also pointed downwards towards the pole (not at all at the equator, but vertically downwards at the pole \u2013 where compasses are useless for that reason). William Gilbert in 1600 first understood what this meant, by experimenting with how a sphere of lodestone (representing the Earth) affected a lodestone needle moved across its surface. He realized that it was not a star, nor magnetic mountains, but the whole Earth that acted as a magnet.<br><br>And now it is known (though this is something that I cannot truly fathom either) that the magnetic field is the product of the Earth\u2019s molten core (which has, though, a solid centre). It is the electric eddy currents in the slowly swirling molten iron-nickel outer core, allied to the Earth\u2019s spin around its axis, which produces the Earth\u2019s magnetic field.
