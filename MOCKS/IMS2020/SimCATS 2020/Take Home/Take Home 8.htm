It\u2019s stressful and misleading. In fact, the vast majority of the world\u2019s population live somewhere in the middle of the income scale. Their girls go to school, their children get vaccinated. Perhaps not on every single measure, or every single year, but step by step, year by year, the world is improving. In the past two centuries, life expectancy has more than doubled.

It is not caused simply by out-of-date knowledge. My experience, over decades of lecturing and testing, has finally brought me to see that the overdramatic worldview comes from the very way our brains work. The brain is a product of millions of years of evolution, and we are hard-wired with instincts that helped our ancestors to survive in small groups of hunters and gatherers. We crave sugar and fat, which used to be life-saving sources of energy when food was scarce. But today these cravings make obesity one of the biggest global health problems. In the same way, we are interested in gossip and dramatic stories, which used to be the only source of news and useful information. This craving for drama causes misconceptions and helps create an overdramatic worldview.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">We still need these dramatic instincts to give meaning to our world. If we sifted every input and analysed every decision rationally, a normal life would be impossible. Just as we should not cut out all sugar and fat, we should not ask a surgeon to remove the parts of our brain that deal with emotions. But we need to learn to control our drama intake.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Over the past 20 years, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty has almost halved. But in online polls, in most countries, fewer than 10% of people knew this. Our instinct to notice the bad more than the good is related to three things: the misremembering of the past; selective reporting by journalists and activists; and the feeling that as long as things are bad, it\u2019s heartless to say they are getting better. For centuries, older people have romanticised their youths and insisted that things ain\u2019t what they used to be. Well, that\u2019s true. Most things used to be worse. This tendency to misremember is compounded by the never-ending negative news from across the world.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Stories about gradual improvements rarely make the front page even when they occur on a dramatic scale and affect millions of people. And thanks to increasing press freedom and improving technology, we hear about more disasters than ever before. This improved reporting is itself a sign of human progress, but it creates the impression of the exact opposite. Everything is not fine. We should still be very concerned. But it is ridiculous to look away from the progress that has been made. When people wrongly believe that nothing is improving, they may lose confidence in measures that actually work.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">How can we help our brains to realise that things are getting better? Think of the world as a very sick premature baby in an incubator. After a week, she is improving, but she has to stay in the incubator because her health is still critical. Does it make sense to say that the infant\u2019s situation is improving? Yes. Does it make sense to say it is bad? Yes, absolutely. Does saying \u201cthings are improving\u201d imply that everything is fine, and we should all not worry? Not at all: it\u2019s both bad and better.

The first paragraph states that the neutrinos\u00a0\u201care so elusive that physicists all over the world can\u2019t stop obsessing about them.\u201d In the last paragraph, the author states that\u00a0\u201cneutrinos might not have the same headline potential of a new cancer treatment. But understanding them is the key to our understanding of the universe.\u201d The author does not compare the importance of advancing medicine to that of researching neutrinos. Also, the author uses a positive tone while listing the benefits of researching neutrinos. The author does not want to get over with the research of neutrinos and then move on to more important issues, as suggested by this option. Thus, option 4 is not listed as a potential benefit and is the correct answer.

It is closer to the tobacco or fast-food industries, where vested interests deny the existence of blatant problems that were not there before. To ignore it, to let companies shape and exploit and steal our lives, would be the ultra-conservative option.\u201d The one that says free markets have their own morality.\u201d Bulimia is constant craving for food. Anorexia means a prolonged loss of appetite. Option 1 is incorrect because the bulimia and anorexia set the writer thinking and made him realize that the situation was unlike Bob Dylan\u2019s guitar. But reason for the comparison was different. Hence eliminate option 1. Option 2 is incorrect \u2013 there may be an implied reference to the addiction as tobacco and fast food are addictive. However, the reason for the comparison is not directly the factor of addiction. Hence option 2 is a possible answer but not the answer. Option 4, similar to option 2 is an implication, which is a rationalisation indulged in by social media companies by transferring the blame to the victims by invoking free will and free markets. So we can eliminate option 4. Option 3 is correct. The comparison is directly attributed to the control exercised by vested interests in both the industries \u2013 tobacco and fast food industries on the one hand, and social media on the other \u2013 who would deliberately deny the existence of problems which their products create in society. Hence option 3 is the correct answer.<\/span><\/p>@@@~SimCAT-8-2018-VA-RC-Q.21","VideoExplanation":null,"DocxSolutionUrl":null,"SolutionUploadedType":null,"PlayerMode":"VIMEO","VimeoLink":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/366430942","VimeoURI":"\/videos\/366430942","YoutubeURL":null,"ItemBankID":0,"Difficulty":"Easy","DifficultyLevel":4,"ItemBank":0,"QuestionPaper":0,"IsProofRead":null,"CorrectIndex":0,"QuestionPaperSectionID":8514,"IsRequiredQuestion":null,"TestID":0,"IsQuestionPackTimer":null,"SelectedOption":null,"IsCorrected":null,"EnteredResponse":null,"IsMarked":null,"OriginalTestID":null,"TimePerQuestion":0,"IsAttempt":null,"timetaken":null,"StudentMCAResponse":null,"ItemOptionResponse":[{"ItemOptionID":660043,"ItemID":155775,"Options":"<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">It triggered or exacerbated illnesses like bulimia and anorexia. <\/span><\/p>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":660044,"ItemID":155775,"Options":"<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">It made people addicted to it and stole people\u2019s lives. <\/span><\/p>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":660045,"ItemID":155775,"Options":"<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">It is controlled by vested interests that create new problems in society. <\/span><\/p>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":true,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":660046,"ItemID":155775,"Options":"<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">It believes that free markets have their own corrective mechanisms. <\/span><\/p>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0}],"qindex":20,"qsectionindex":0,"qindexbysection":20},{"IsPassageQuestionSplit":true,"MaxWords":0,"ItemID":155776,"ItemType":"MCQ","SubjectName":"Verbal Ability","SubjectID":203,"AreaName":"Reading Comprehension","AreaID":501,"TopicName":"Specific Detail","TopicID":4984,"ItemOptions":null,"SubTopicID":0,"StarRating":null,"ItemBankName":null,"Direction":"","Title":"Q.22","IsApproved":null,"Items":"<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">Which of the following statements holds true for the compounds called perovskites?<\/span><\/p>","ItemPassageID":17288,"PassageItemIndex":0,"Passage":"<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\"><strong>The passage below is accompanied by questions.

The object is something that presumably exists independent of the subject\u2019s perception of it. In other words, the object would be there, as it is, even if no subject perceived it. Hence, objectivity is typically associated with ideas such as reality, truth and reliability. The perceiving subject can either perceive accurately or seem to perceive features of the object that are not in the object. For example, a perceiving subject suffering from jaundice could seem to perceive an object as yellow when the object is not actually yellow.

The pronoun \u201cthey\u201d in statement 3 refers to students mentioned in statement 1. Also, \u201cthis\u201d refers to \u201ctry new strategies and seek input\u201d. Note that \u201cthey\u201d in statement 3 cannot refer to \u201cstudents\u201d in statement 2, the latter being a possessive noun and part of the compound noun, \u201cstudents\u2019 achievement\u201d. Thus, we get the mandatory pair 1-3. <\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">If we start the passage with 1-3, we come to a dead-end after 3. No other statement logically follows statement 3. <\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Statement 4 introduces the theme of the passage, i.e. relationship between growth mindset and effort, by using the article \u201ca\u201d to refer to growth mindset. Thus, statement 4 is the starter sentence. <\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Statement 5 further elaborates on the theme by stating that equating \u201cthe growth mindset\u201d with \u201ceffort\u201d is a common misconception. Clearly, this is not the starter sentence since it uses the article \u201cthe\u201d to refer to growth mindset. <\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Statement 2 emphasizes that effort is the key to students\u2019 achievement, but that it\u2019s not the only thing. Either statement 5 or 2 can follow statement 4. Also note that there is a logical connection between statements 2 and 1, both of which talk about students. Thus, we can conclude that statement 2 will precede the 1-3 mandatory pair (2-1-3) and that statement 5 will follow statement 4 (4-5). <\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Thus, we get the correct sequence as 45213.<\/span><\/p>@@@~SimCAT-8-2018-VA-RC-Q.33","VideoExplanation":null,"DocxSolutionUrl":null,"SolutionUploadedType":null,"PlayerMode":"VIMEO","VimeoLink":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/366427862","VimeoURI":"\/videos\/366427862","YoutubeURL":null,"ItemBankID":0,"Difficulty":"Easy","DifficultyLevel":4,"ItemBank":0,"QuestionPaper":0,"IsProofRead":null,"CorrectIndex":0,"QuestionPaperSectionID":8514,"IsRequiredQuestion":null,"TestID":0,"IsQuestionPackTimer":null,"SelectedOption":null,"IsCorrected":null,"EnteredResponse":null,"IsMarked":null,"OriginalTestID":null,"TimePerQuestion":0,"IsAttempt":null,"timetaken":null,"StudentMCAResponse":null,"ItemOptionResponse":[{"ItemOptionID":660091,"ItemID":155787,"Options":"<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">45213<\/span><\/p>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":true,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":660092,"ItemID":155787,"Options":"<p>x<\/p>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":660093,"ItemID":155787,"Options":"<p>y<\/p>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":660094,"ItemID":155787,"Options":"<p>z<\/p>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0}],"qindex":32,"qsectionindex":0,"qindexbysection":32},{"IsPassageQuestionSplit":true,"MaxWords":0,"ItemID":155788,"ItemType":"NE","SubjectName":"Verbal Ability","SubjectID":203,"AreaName":"Verbal Reasoning","AreaID":500,"TopicName":"Jumbled Paragraphs","TopicID":4992,"ItemOptions":null,"SubTopicID":0,"StarRating":null,"ItemBankName":null,"Direction":"","Title":"Q.34","IsApproved":null,"Items":"<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><strong>The five sentences (labelled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) given in this question, when properly sequenced, form a coherent paragraph.
