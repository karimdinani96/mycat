That\u2019s because the gravity associated with large masses may be pulling matter into seemingly ordered states \u2013 with the increase in disorder that we think must have taken place being somehow hidden away in the gravitational fields. So disorder could be increasing even though we don\u2019t see it.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But given nature\u2019s tendency to prefer disorder, why did the universe start off in such an ordered state in the first place? This is still considered a mystery. Some researchers argue that the Big Bang may not even have been the beginning, there may in fact be \u201cparallel universes\" where time runs in different directions.<\/span><\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":false,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\"> This is a difficult question. <\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\"> The darkness of the night sky is mentioned in order to point to the fact that light sources in the universe are finite as the universe itself is finite. And this points to the fact that\u00a0 there is a point where the universe and therefore time, as we know it, began. The first\u00a0 paragraph states: \u201cIf the universe had an infinite past and was infinite in extent, the night\u00a0 sky would be completely bright \u2013 filled with the light from an infinite number of stars in a\u00a0 cosmos that had always existed.\u201d\u00a0 <\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\"> Option 1 is incorrect. The passage explains that \u2018time\u2019, as we know it, originated with Big\u00a0 Bang. Option 1 is contrary to this. Eliminate option 1.\u00a0 <\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\"> Option 2 is correct. The darkness of the night sky is an indication that there is a\u00a0 beginning for time as we know it. As the first paragraph states, the universe clearly has a\u00a0 finite past, as can be inferred from the finite stars that light up the night sky. Also,\u00a0 paragraph 2 states: \u201cThis means that it must have originated from a more compact state\u00a0 that we call the Big Bang, implying that time does have a beginning.\u201d Therefore, retain\u00a0 option 2. <\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\"> Option 3 is incorrect. \u2018Few\u2019 is a relative term. The number of light sources is less\u00a0 important than the fact that light sources are not infinite. But in an infinite universe the\u00a0 light sources would also be infinite. Reject option 3. <\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\"> Option 4 is incorrect. The passage goes on to say that the universe had a definite\u00a0 beginning-- that it has not always existed.

If the universe had an infinite past and was infinite in extent, the night sky would be completely bright \u2013 filled with the light from an infinite number of stars in a cosmos that had always existed.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">For a long time scientists, including Albert Einstein, thought that the universe was static and infinite. Observations have since shown that it is in fact expanding, and at an accelerating rate. This means that it must have originated from a more compact state that we call the Big Bang, implying that time does have a beginning. In fact, if we look for light that is old enough we can even see the relic radiation from Big Bang \u2013 the cosmic microwave background. Realising this was a first step in determining the age of the universe.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But there is a snag, Einstein\u2019s special theory of relativity, shows that time is \u2026 relative: the faster you move relative to me, the slower time will pass for you relative to my perception of time. So in our universe of expanding galaxies, spinning stars and swirling planets, experiences of time vary: everything\u2019s past, present and future is relative.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">So is there a universal time that we could all agree on?<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It turns out that because the universe is on average the same everywhere, and on average looks the same in every direction, there does exist a \u201ccosmic time\u201d. To measure it, all we have to do is measure the properties of the cosmic microwave background. Cosmologists have used this to determine the age of the universe; its cosmic age. It turns out that the universe is 13.799 billion years old.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">So we know time most likely started during the Big Bang. But there is one nagging question that remains: what exactly is time?<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">To unpack this question, we have to look at the basic properties of space and time. In the dimension of space, you can move forwards and backwards; commuters experience this everyday. But time is different, it has a direction, you always move forward, never in reverse. So why is the dimension of time irreversible? This is one of the major unsolved problems in physics.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">To explain why time itself is irreversible, we need to find processes in nature that are also irreversible. One of the few such concepts in physics (and life!) is that things tend to become less \u201ctidy\u201d as time passes. We describe this using a physical property called entropy that encodes how ordered something is.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Imagine a box of gas in which all the particles were initially placed in one corner (an ordered state). Over time they would naturally seek to fill the entire box (a disordered state) \u2013 and to put the particles back into an ordered state would require energy. This is irreversible. It\u2019s like cracking an egg to make an omelette \u2013 once it spreads out and fills the frying pan, it will never go back to being egg-shaped. It\u2019s the same with the universe: as it evolves, the overall entropy increases.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It turns out entropy is a pretty good way to explain time\u2019s arrow. And while it may seem like the universe is becoming more ordered rather than less \u2013 going from a wild sea of relatively uniformly spread out hot gas in its early stages to stars, planets, humans and articles about time \u2013 it\u2019s nevertheless possible that it is increasing in disorder. That\u2019s because the gravity associated with large masses may be pulling matter into seemingly ordered states \u2013 with the increase in disorder that we think must have taken place being somehow hidden away in the gravitational fields. So disorder could be increasing even though we don\u2019t see it.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But given nature\u2019s tendency to prefer disorder, why did the universe start off in such an ordered state in the first place? This is still considered a mystery. Some researchers argue that the Big Bang may not even have been the beginning, there may in fact be \u201cparallel universes\" where time runs in different directions.<\/span><\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":false,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\"> This is an easy question. <\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\">Option 1 is true of Entropy and follows from what has been said in the passage.

The passage, then, relates the advent and spread of agriculture to genetic studies. A \u201cY-chromosomal signature haplogroup J\u201d is believed to be associated with the spread of modern agriculture, because the gene has its highest frequency in the Fertile Crescent region, where modern agriculture was invented 7000 to 10000 years ago.

Just to be sure that no one thinks that the practice of agriculture is in the genes, I would like to point out that the spread of the technology of agriculture was associated with the movement of people; agriculturists who took the technology to new regions and taught it to the locals in the new region. Movement of people implies movement of genes. Some migrants \u2018export\u2019 their genes to a new region by taking spouses from the new region and producing children with them who stay in the new region. We can never be sure that the attribution of agriculture having been introduced to the Indian subcontinent by migrants is fully true. However, genetic data do support this model, especially of the spread of modern, organized agriculture.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Having said this, I must also emphasize, once again, that collection of more extensive data is always more helpful in understanding our past and of the spread of our inventions and innovations. A Y-chromosomal signature, haplogroup J, was shown to be associated with the spread of modern agriculture. This signature has its highest frequency in the Fertile Crescent region \u2013 the region comprising the present-day countries of Syria, Lebanon, Turkey \u2013 where the technology of modern agriculture was invented about 7,000\u201310,000 years ago. Collection of deeper data showed that this signature is quite heterogeneous and is composed of at least four sub-signatures, one of which \u2013 haplogroup J2b2 \u2013 is confined to the India\u2013Pakistan region.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">This sub-signature arose over 13,000 years ago and hence its introduction into India could not have been by migrants who introduced modern agriculture into India. We showed that the haplogroup J2b2 possibly arose in India, because the highest frequency of this haplogroup is found in India. We discovered multiple epicentres of this haplogroup in India and interestingly these epicentres neatly coincided with the seats of introduction of early forms of agriculture in India (as evidenced by the study of fossilized pollen grains by Fuller and his team). It is unlikely that haplogroup J arose independently multiple times in geographically separated places. It probably arose in an ancient population who had spread themselves in geographically separated regions and they invented rudimentary forms of agriculture independently in multiple geographical regions. However, it is notable that these early forms of agriculture remained largely confined to India and Pakistan region.<\/span><\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":false,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\"> This is an easy question. <\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\">The third paragraph states thus: \u2018We showed that the haplogroup J2b2 possibly arose in India, because the highest frequency of this haplogroup is found in India.\u2019 From this, it is clear that option 2 is true. <\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\">Similarly, the author, in the first paragraph states, \u2018I would like to point out that the spread of the technology of agriculture was associated with the movement of people; agriculturists who took the technology to new regions and taught it to the locals in the new region\u2019. Thus, option 3 is true as well. <\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\">The second paragraph mentions, \u2018Collection of deeper data showed that this signature is quite heterogeneous and is composed of at least four sub-signatures, one of which \u2013 haplogroup J2b2 \u2013 is confined to the India\u2013Pakistan region\u2019. Hence, option 4 is also true. <\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\">However, the second paragraph also states that \u2018haplogroup J was shown to be associated with the spread of modern agriculture.

We can thus conclude that there is a correlation between haplogroup J and agriculture. However, the passage presents no data that can conclude that haplogroup J caused the invention of agriculture. Hence, the presence of haplogroup J and agriculture in a particular region can be said to be just a case of correlation, and not that of causation. In the first paragraph, the author cautions against such a mistaken belief. \u201cJust to be sure that no one thinks that the practice of agriculture is in the genes, I would like to point out that the spread of the technology of agriculture was associated with the movement of people\u201d Hence, option 1 cannot be said to be true. <\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\">Hence the correct answer is option 1.<\/span><\/p>","VideoExplanation":"https:\/\/d2t84gkuc8yg6i.cloudfront.net\/ims\/SimCAT-9-2018-VA-RC-Q.13\/output.mdpmaster.m3u8","DocxSolutionUrl":null,"SolutionUploadedType":null,"PlayerMode":"VIMEO","VimeoLink":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/366429561","VimeoURI":"\/videos\/366429561","YoutubeURL":null,"ItemBankID":0,"Difficulty":"Easy","DifficultyLevel":4,"ItemBank":0,"QuestionPaper":0,"IsProofRead":null,"CorrectIndex":0,"QuestionPaperSectionID":8543,"IsRequiredQuestion":null,"TestID":0,"IsQuestionPackTimer":null,"SelectedOption":null,"IsCorrected":null,"EnteredResponse":null,"IsMarked":null,"OriginalTestID":null,"TimePerQuestion":0,"IsAttempt":null,"timetaken":null,"StudentMCAResponse":null,"ItemOptionResponse":[{"ItemOptionID":662788,"ItemID":156443,"Options":"<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The genetic signature haplogroup J caused the invention of agriculture.<\/span><\/p>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":true,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":662789,"ItemID":156443,"Options":"<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The haplogroup J2b2 probably arose in India.<\/span><\/p>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":662790,"ItemID":156443,"Options":"<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The spread of the technology of agriculture was associated with the movement of people.<\/span><\/p>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":662791,"ItemID":156443,"Options":"<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The haplogroup J has more sub-signatures than just J2b2.<\/span><\/p>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0}],"qindex":12,"qsectionindex":0,"qindexbysection":12},{"IsPassageQuestionSplit":true,"MaxWords":0,"ItemID":156444,"ItemType":"MCQ","SubjectName":"Verbal Ability","SubjectID":203,"AreaName":"Reading Comprehension","AreaID":501,"TopicName":"Inference","TopicID":4985,"ItemOptions":null,"SubTopicID":0,"StarRating":null,"ItemBankName":null,"Direction":"","Title":"Q.14","IsApproved":null,"Items":"<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The main conclusion of the review is that Stevens has:<\/span><\/p>","ItemPassageID":17378,"PassageItemIndex":0,"Passage":"<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;\"><strong> The passage below is accompanied by a set of six questions.

Mr Stevens is chief of staff at an English stately home; as the novel opens, in the summer of 1956, he is set to undertake a motoring trip to visit Miss Kenton, a housekeeper who left 20 years earlier to get married. The butler says he wants to ask her if she\u2019d consider returning to work: \u201cMiss Kenton, with her great affection for this house, with her exemplary professionalism, was just the factor needed to enable me to complete a fully satisfactory staff plan for Darlington Hall.\u201d But Stevens isn\u2019t fooling anyone, especially when he lets slip that a letter (\u201cher first in seven years, discounting Christmas cards\u201d) contains hints her marriage is falling apart.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Unreliable narrators \u2013 those mysterious figures the reader must try to work out \u2013 are ten a penny in fiction.

Bit by bit, you learn to look for the real emotions running beneath the buffed surface of the prose.

A disinterested person is impartial, unbiased, or has no stake in the outcome; an uninterested person is bored, unconcerned, or indifferent. The researchers in the context of the first sentence are not uninterested or bored and unconcerned people; they are objectively looking at the theory i.e., without biases. Hence, \u2018disinterested\u2019 is correct in the context. Similarly, loath vs. loathe have different meanings and different uses within a sentence. Loathe is a verb which means to detest or dislike. Loath is an adjective which means reluctant or unwilling. The adjective ends with a hard\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"> and rhymes with\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">growth<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"> or\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">both<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">.

The context of the second sentence requires a verb. Hence, we get 11 in these two sentences. In sentence 3, we need the second choice or \u201caltogether\u201d. \u201cAltogether\u201d is an adverb meaning \u201ccompletely,\u201d or \u201centirely\u201d. For example: \u201cWhen he first saw the examination questions, he was altogether (or completely) baffled.\u201d \u201cAll together,\u201d in contrast, is a phrase meaning, \u201cin a group.\u201d It is never used as a phrasal adverb. Hence, the correct choice here is option 2 meaning \u2018totally or wholly\u201d as an adverb modifying \u201cworth\u201d. In sentence 4, the verbs \u201ctitillate\u201d and \u201ctitivate\u201d sound alike but do not have the same meaning.

Effect as a verb means \u2018to bring about\u2019 and affect as a verb means \u2018to influence\u2019. In sentence A, \u2018effect\u2019 is the correct choice because it means the medications did not bring about any change in the condition of the disease. Hence, (1) is the answer. In sentence B, the two-word expression\u00a0a while is a noun phrase, consisting of the article\u00a0a and the noun\u00a0while\u00a0(time). The one-word\u00a0awhile is an adverb that means \u201cfor a short time or period.\u201d (we say, \u201cstay awhile\u201d meaning \u2018stay for some time\u2019, or \u2018stay for a while\u2019). In the current context the single word a while gives a meaningful sentence. So, we get 12 for the first two sentences. In sentence C, we have another confusing pair less\/ and fewer. The basic rule about the precise uses of \u201cless\u201d and \u201cfewer\u201d is simple. Use \u201cfewer\u201d with countable, individual things, and \u201cless\u201d with uncountable amounts, volumes, etc. So: \u201cI should drink less coffee,\u201d but \u201cI should eat fewer doughnuts.\u201d However, use less with a number that describes a quantity considered as a single bulk amount:\u00a0 <\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\">\u201cThe police recovered less than Rs. 1000\/-\u201c ; or \u201cIt happened less than five years ago\u201d; \u201cThe recipe calls for less than two cups of sugar\u201d etc. Since sentence C refers to a time span, we have to use\u00a0less than three weeks. So, we get 121 in the first three sentences. In sentence D, incidence is correct. The singular noun incidence usually refers to the rate at which something happens, as in \u2018The city has taken measures to reduce the incidence of vandalism\u2019. Incidence is sometimes confused with the similar-sounding words incidents. Incident is an event or happening. Incidence means occurrence. In the context, we need to say \u2018the occurrence of vandalism\u2019. Hence, 2.\u00a0 <\/span><br \/> <br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\">The correct answer is 1212.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>","VideoExplanation":"https:\/\/d2t84gkuc8yg6i.cloudfront.net\/ims\/SimCAT-9-2018-VA-RC-Q.34\/output.mdpmaster.m3u8","DocxSolutionUrl":null,"SolutionUploadedType":null,"PlayerMode":"VIMEO","VimeoLink":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/366427476","VimeoURI":"\/videos\/366427476","YoutubeURL":null,"ItemBankID":0,"Difficulty":"Easy","DifficultyLevel":4,"ItemBank":0,"QuestionPaper":0,"IsProofRead":null,"CorrectIndex":0,"QuestionPaperSectionID":8543,"IsRequiredQuestion":null,"TestID":0,"IsQuestionPackTimer":null,"SelectedOption":null,"IsCorrected":null,"EnteredResponse":null,"IsMarked":null,"OriginalTestID":null,"TimePerQuestion":0,"IsAttempt":null,"timetaken":null,"StudentMCAResponse":null,"ItemOptionResponse":[{"ItemOptionID":662872,"ItemID":156464,"Options":"<p>1212<\/p>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":true,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":662873,"ItemID":156464,"Options":"<p>x<\/p>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":662874,"ItemID":156464,"Options":"<p>y<\/p>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":662875,"ItemID":156464,"Options":"<p>z<\/p>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0}],"qindex":33,"qsectionindex":0,"qindexbysection":33},{"IsPassageQuestionSplit":true,"MaxWords":0,"ItemID":156465,"ItemType":"MCQ","SubjectName":"Data Interpretation","SubjectID":454,"AreaName":"Data Interpretation","AreaID":1417,"TopicName":"Table","TopicID":5846,"ItemOptions":null,"SubTopicID":0,"StarRating":null,"ItemBankName":null,"Direction":"","Title":"Q.1","IsApproved":null,"Items":"<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">What is the average total score of all the six students?<\/span><\/p>","ItemPassageID":17380,"PassageItemIndex":0,"Passage":"<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><strong>Refer<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><strong> to the data below and answer the questions that follow.<\/strong><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><strong><br \/><\/strong><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Bruce, Natasha, Peter, Steve, Tony and Wanda are students of Marvel International School.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Their final exam marks in the various subjects are given below with a few values missing.
