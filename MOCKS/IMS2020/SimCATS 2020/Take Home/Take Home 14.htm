In his bestselling The Life of the Robin (1943), Lack argued that in order to study animal life you had to know the animals individually. Colour-coded rings on the legs of each robin meant that the daily observations of individual birds could accumulate into individual histories, enabling Lack to set present-day behaviour in the context of past events.

In many ways, they took the first steps towards being able to see what it might mean to be an animal.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>Tinbergen and Lack (among others) were critical of both field scientists who indulged in lazy anthropomorphism, and those who insisted on setting up \u2018artificial standards of simplicity\u2019. In particular, they objected to the dismissal of any apparently sophisticated animal action as \u2018instinctive\u2019. Such behaviour needed to be investigated, not marginalized: what was instinct, after all? At the same time, they argued that assuming parity between animal and human mental processes was not just wrong, but foolish.

This was presented to individual birds to see how they would respond to a stranger\u2019s presence; since the ornament itself never changed, it could, argued Lack, be used as a means of objectively testing robin personality or temperament. One day, however, it did change \u2013 fatally. An \u2018exceptionally violent hen robin attacked [it] so strongly that she removed his head. For a moment, the bird seemed rather startled, but then continued to attack \u2026 as violently as before.\u2019 Further investigations established that just a tuft of red feathers could provoke a brutal response that might continue even after the feathers\u2019 complete disappearance. Lack wrote: \u2018We tend to think that, clothed in a robin\u2019s body, but retaining a human mind, we would do much the same things in much the same way \u2026 We tend to assume that the world the robin sees is much like the world which we see. Suitable experiments show how false this impression is. Even the empty air can contain a rival to be destroyed.\u2019<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>Tinbergen and others agreed: while their aim was to see the world with animal eyes, they worked with the caveat that animal mentalities were neither similar to nor less than those of humans. They were, instead, different \u2013 and different animals possessed different minds, often\u00a0<\/span>prioritizing different senses.

Similarly, in Curious Naturalists (1958) Tinbergen used coloured dots to identify individual wasps on the sands of Hulshorst in the Netherlands.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>These two men, founders in the fields of ethology and ecology, realized that individual identification was the first stage in adopting the animal perspective and exploring the lived consciousness of other species. Rather than using human experiences \u2013 that sense of self-conscious subjectivity \u2013 as their yardstick, they focused instead on individual animal behaviour as it occurred within the environment in which it had evolved. In many ways, they took the first steps towards being able to see what it might mean to be an animal.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>Tinbergen and Lack (among others) were critical of both field scientists who indulged in lazy anthropomorphism, and those who insisted on setting up \u2018artificial standards of simplicity\u2019. In particular, they objected to the dismissal of any apparently sophisticated animal action as \u2018instinctive\u2019. Such behaviour needed to be investigated, not marginalized: what was instinct, after all? At the same time, they argued that assuming parity between animal and human mental processes was not just wrong, but foolish. Lack was clear that speculating about an animal\u2019s emotional state could provide valuable clues to guide future study, but one should never presume that a bird feels or perceives in the same way as a human.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>Lack demonstrated the point with great elegance using a stuffed robin. This was presented to individual birds to see how they would respond to a stranger\u2019s presence; since the ornament itself never changed, it could, argued Lack, be used as a means of objectively testing robin personality or temperament. One day, however, it did change \u2013 fatally. An \u2018exceptionally violent hen robin attacked [it] so strongly that she removed his head. For a moment, the bird seemed rather startled, but then continued to attack \u2026 as violently as before.\u2019 Further investigations established that just a tuft of red feathers could provoke a brutal response that might continue even after the feathers\u2019 complete disappearance. Lack wrote: \u2018We tend to think that, clothed in a robin\u2019s body, but retaining a human mind, we would do much the same things in much the same way \u2026 We tend to assume that the world the robin sees is much like the world which we see. Suitable experiments show how false this impression is. Even the empty air can contain a rival to be destroyed.\u2019<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>Tinbergen and others agreed: while their aim was to see the world with animal eyes, they worked with the caveat that animal mentalities were neither similar to nor less than those of humans. They were, instead, different \u2013 and different animals possessed different minds, often\u00a0<\/span>prioritizing different senses. No matter how hard a human tried to see through animal eyes, they would find it impossible to figure out how a pig\u2019s biography would smell.<\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":false,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<p>This is a difficult question.\u00a0<br \/><span>Refer to the last paragraph, especially the sentence: \u2018No matter how hard a human tried to see through animal eyes, they would find it impossible to figure out how a pig\u2019s biography would smell.\u2019<\/span>\u00a0<br \/><span>Option [1] is incorrect, as it is too literal a reading of the quoted sentence.

On the other hand, the former are societies where the house is the focal point, while the town, village or hamlet functions mainly as the route through which one passes in order to reach the essential privacies of the houses. The reason for such differences is frequently put down to climate, and it is certainly more pleasant to spend an autumn afternoon in a market square on the Mediterranean than it is in Oslo.

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/strong><\/span><br \/><br \/><span>Have we become too obsessed with giving awards, especially participation awards, for youth sports? With trophies given out like candy, have they lost their meaning?<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>If children always receive a trophy \u2013 regardless of effort or achievement \u2013 we\u2019re teaching kids that losing is so terrible that we can never let it happen. This is a destructive message, because how we react to kids\u2019 failure is just as crucial as celebrating their success. A recent study found if parents thought failure was debilitating, their kids adopted that perspective. If parents believed overcoming failure and mistakes made you stronger, then their children believed it, too.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>Thus letting kids lose, or not take home the trophy, isn\u2019t about embarrassing children. It\u2019s about teaching them it can take a long time to get good at something, and that\u2019s all right. Kids need to know they don\u2019t have to win every time. It\u2019s O.K. to lose, to make a mistake. (In a study of Gold Medal Olympians, they said a previous loss was key to their championships.) It\u2019s through failure and mistakes that we learn the most. We must focus on process and progress, not results and rewards.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>Some claim that constant awards improve children\u2019s self-esteem, and, once kids have high self-esteem, they\u2019ll achieve more. But scientists have tested these claims and found them to be false. Kids with already high self-esteem see the trophies as vindication they really are as wonderful as they see themselves. In a longitudinal study, when parents regularly overpraised their children\u2019s performances, their children were more likely to be narcissistic two years later.<\/span><br \/><br \/>And for kids with low self-esteem, undeserved praise doesn\u2019t help them, either. Research has found that kids with low self-esteem believe they can\u2019t live up to their own hype, so they withdraw even further.<br \/><br \/><span>Research has found that the best way to improve kids\u2019 self-image is to help them develop their abilities. Once they master a skill, they won\u2019t need manufactured praise to tell them they\u2019ve done well. They\u2019ll know it. And they\u2019ll be thrilled. Like the child who just learned to tie her shoes. That sense of accomplishment is worth more than any trophy.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>Therefore, instead of blowing a team\u2019s budget on participation trophies, spend that money on kids\u2019 and coaches\u2019 skill development. Or donate the money to kids who can\u2019t afford the basic equipment they need to develop their own skills.<\/span><\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":false,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<p>This question is of medium difficulty.\u00a0<br \/><span>Option [1] is incorrect, as the author would agree with it.

However, for each striker, based on his performance, i.e. the number of goals scored in each of the penalty shootouts, the number of attempts at goal in each of his subsequent penalty shootouts are revised as per the following criteria:<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>1.<\/span>\u00a0<span>In any penalty shootout, if the number of goals scored by a striker is at least 50%, but not 100%, of the total number of available attempts at goal (after all applicable revisions), he gets a bonus attempt at goal in each of his subsequent penalty shootouts.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>2.<\/span>\u00a0<span>In any penalty shootout, if a striker scores in all the possible attempts at goal (after all applicable revisions), then he gets three bonus attempts at goal in each of his subsequent possible attempts.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>3.<\/span>\u00a0<span>In any penalty shootout, for each goal scored, a striker is awarded 10 points by the manager and for each failed attempt at goal, he is penalised 3 points by the manager. The same point scheme is followed for all the attempts at goal, including the bonus attempts. The striker with maximum points, in all the four penalty shootouts put together, will be selected for the position of striker in the playing eleven at the Champions League Final against Football Club Barcelona.<\/span><\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":true,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">Given that Martial scored 17 points in PS 2.
