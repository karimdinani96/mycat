Fast radio bursts, or FRBs, are millisecond-long bursts of radio waves in space. Individual radio bursts emit once and don't repeat. But repeating fast radio bursts are known to send out short, energetic radio waves multiple times. And usually when they repeat, it's sporadic or in a cluster, according to previous observations. Between September 16, 2018 and October 30, 2019, researchers with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment detected a pattern in bursts occurring every 16.35 days. Over the course of four days, the signal would release a burst or two each hour. Then, it would go silent for another 12 days \u2026 The signal is a known repeating fast radio burst, FRB 180916.

Now, the evidence of a pattern in the signal adds to the question of what could cause these bursts to emit the way that they do. \"The discovery of a 16.35-day periodicity in a repeating FRB source is an important clue to the nature of this object,\" the researchers wrote in their study.

The total of all of them is 315. If we want to have three terms in Arithmetic Progression with a common difference of 14, the three terms will be 91, 105 &amp; 119. This means that the three colours must have these three totals. <br \/>Among 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56 &amp; 63; we can have 7, 14, 21, 28 &amp; 63 are such that 7, 14 &amp; 28 make a GP or 7, 21 &amp; 63 make a GP. <br \/>Now, one of 21 &amp; 63 must be with 14 &amp; other with 28. If we place 21 with 14, total till now becomes 35, only 56 can be added to it to make one of the three totals mentioned above. Now, this total becomes 91. As far as the group of 63 &amp; 28 is concerned, there total is already 91. We cannot add any number to it to make one of the totals given above. So, this case is not feasible. Therefore, 63 must be with 14 &amp; 21 must be with 28. <br \/><img style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" src=\"http:\/\/campusquizkybv.blob.core.windows.net\/bvcdevitemimages\/docximg_119035553_image11.png\" data-docx-image=\"image11.png\" \/> <br \/>Now, the only number that can be added to 14 &amp; 63 is 42 to make it one of the totals given above.

Also, the difference of any two cards of a particular colour was not highest for Yellow. The highest difference in the table is 49. Thus, Red cards have numbers (7, 35, 49). Green cards have numbers (14, 63, 42).
