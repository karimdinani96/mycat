When all this material fell into the water of Mars' (probable) ancient ocean, it created a towering tsunami stretching between 25 and 43 miles long that crashed against the shore of the planet's northern hemisphere. \r<br>\r<br>A new study in Planetary and Space Science identifies the remnants of this long-ago event. The landslide-induced tsunami would have required a large body of water, yet more evidence for the case in favour of the existence of a long-disappeared Martian ocean. Martian tsunamis are not a new idea. In 2015, researchers showed that impactors from space had splashed into the planet's ancient ocean and kicked up giant waves. The newest findings could also help planetary scientists pin down how big the ocean might have been.\r<br>\r<br>Landslide-generated tsunamis are frequent on Earth, says Fabio Vittorio De Blasio, a scientist at the Italy's University of Milan and the author of the new research. To show the same thing could have happened on Mars, De Blasio studied satellite images of the planet's topography, more specifically the remains of the enormous landslide. At 370 to 430 miles long, the scar is \"probably the largest single landslide deposit on Mars,\" he says, and possibly the longest landslide in the solar system. When these rocks tumbled down the mountain billions of years ago, de Blasio argues, they slammed into the water to create an enormous wave that rushed across the landscape. As the tsunami progressed, the rocks scraped along the solid ground beneath. The sandy, muddy waves left their fingerprints on the shoreline far from Olympus Mons. De Blasio identified the fingerprints, then used models to verify that the waves could have travelled several hundred miles. Olympus Mons towers over the Martian landscape, reaching a staggering 15 miles high. Landslides mar its slopes. Scientists have identified at least ten enormous slides stretching longer than 310 miles. The largest is the western aureole, a ring of fine-grained rock around the volcano that covers land to the north as well as to the west. A single massive landslide created the region. When studying the region at the outer edge of the extensive landslide, De Blasio noticed that unusual deposits marred the ridge. Using images from the NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Odyssey satellites, he studied the surface better to identify the features at the edge of the landslide. The rough surface suggests the presence of ridges created as the rocky landslide slowed. As the flow of material encountered a ridge known as Acheron Dorsum, the material began to rise, creating pressure ridges that are pushed closer together until eventually, the landslide grinds to a halt. As the tsunami crashed against Acheron Dorsum, the sandier and more coarse components fell out of the wave first, creating a smooth layer. Small grains of what was most likely clay-like particles travelled farther, creating mud lobes. According to De Blasio, these deposits are typical of those created by terrestrial tsunamis and are also replicated in experiments.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<p>Refer to paragraph 3: \"At 370 to 430 miles long, the scar is \"probably the largest single landslide deposit on Mars,\" he says, and possibly the longest landslide in the solar system.&rdquo; Option 1 can be inferred to be true from his words.

Choose the best answer for each question.<\/b><\/span><br><br>Lexicographers are persistent creatures. Never content, they scour each newly published edition of a hitherto unprinted text for antedatings or a sighting of a word in the wild that predates the current first citation in the dictionary. Last year, their diligence provided a new entry in the Middle English Dictionary for the word \u2018gibberish\u2019 that, though once thought to be an invention of the mid-16th century, actually makes its first appearance around 1450. A religious guide to vices and virtues warns its readers that to mutter prayers inattentively or without proper piety is to utter \u2018giberisshe too Godde\u2019 (talk gibberish to God). The writer assumes that gibberish is equivalent to foolishness and insincerity. However, what should we think about this strange part of human language-making?<br><br>Though its arrival in English has been redated, the etymological origins of \u2018gibberish\u2019 remain a little mysterious. Samuel Johnson\u2019s Dictionary of the English Language (1755) popularised a folk-etymology connecting \u2018gibberish\u2019 with \u2018chymical cant\u2019, technical terms of alchemy and science as used by \u2018Geber\u2019, the Westernised name of J\u0101bir ibn \u1e24ayy\u0101n, not so much one author but an identity to which much medieval Arabic scholarship was attributed. The truth is much more ordinary: \u2018gibberish\u2019 probably comes from \u2018gibber\u2019, one of a clutch of verbs such as \u2018gobble\u2019, \u2018gabber\u2019, \u2018jabber\u2019 and \u2018gab\u2019 that onomatopoeically imitate the sound of unintelligible babbling. However, the first instance of \u2018gibber\u2019 \u2013 in William Shakespeare\u2019s play Hamlet where the \u2018sheeted dead\u2019, corpses risen from their graves, are imagined to \u2018squeak and gibber\u2019 ominously in the streets of Rome \u2013 comes much later than \u2018gibberish\u2019.<br><br>Gibberish \u2013 language that cannot be understood \u2013 is not quite the same as nonsense. In nonsense writing, we read individual words but cannot parse them into any meaning that makes sense according to conventional expectations. \u2018Colourless green ideas sleep furiously,\u2019 as Noam Chomsky put it in Syntactic Structures (1957), is an example of a semantically meaningless sentence with syntax present and correct. Gibberish, on the other hand, makes obscure words out of the sounds and letters of the language. The giant Nimrod, who, according to patristic tradition, commanded the building of the Tower of Babel and thus shattered humanity\u2019s single language into all of the tongues of the world, is punished with unintelligibility in the Inferno of Dante Alighieri\u2019s Divine Comedy (1308-20). Guarding the Ninth Circle of hell, Nimrod calls out: \u2018Raph\u00e8l ma\u00ec am\u00e8cche zab\u00ec almi.\u2019 Ignore him, says Virgil, his guide, for he cannot understand us, just as we cannot comprehend his words.<br><br>Nimrod\u2019s strange phrase is properly gibberish, letters made into words whose individual meanings escape us, however much scholars puzzle and hypothesise. Yet, gibberish does most of its social work as a wildly inaccurate label. Speech accused of being gibberish is almost always not gibberish but fully functioning language: we take intelligible utterances and turn them into gobbledygook by refusing to recognise or interpret them. For centuries, one nation has sneered at the speakers of another nation\u2019s tongue, belittling the language of others as \u2018barbarian\u2019 (from the Greek \u03b2\u03ac\u03c1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, \u2018Barbaros\u2019, a word said to imitate animalistic baa sounds, how the Greeks supposedly perceived the speech of non-Greek speakers). Nowadays, we dismiss the complicated technical talk of experts as \u2018gibberish\u2019 because we find their terms and expertise intimidating or threatening. Arguments we don\u2019t like are \u2018gobbledygook\u2019 or \u2018word salad\u2019, not because we can\u2019t understand them but because we refuse their logic. (\u2018Word salad\u2019, by the way, is a\u00a0transliteration\u00a0of the German\u00a0Wortsalat, originally a medical term for the muddled-up speech of people with schizophrenia.)","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span>The term appears in paragraph 2: \u201cSamuel Johnson\u2019s Dictionary of the English Language (1755) popularised a folk-etymology connecting \u2018gibberish\u2019 with \u2018chymical cant\u2019, technical terms of alchemy and science as used by \u2018Geber\u2019, the Westernised name of J\u0101bir ibn \u1e24ayy\u0101n, not so much one author but an identity to which much medieval Arabic scholarship was attributed.\u201d Option 1 can be rejected as it incorrectly claims that J\u0101bir ibn \u1e24ayy\u0101n is a real person or a historical figure, while the passage suggests that the term does not refer to a person.
