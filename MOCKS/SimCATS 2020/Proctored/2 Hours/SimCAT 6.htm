The team described the newfound ancestor, named Danuvius Guggemos, in a study published in Nature.<br><br>D. Guggemos was likely a small primate about the size of the baboon, with long arms like a bonobo.

Guggemos was capable of standing with a straighter posture than that of living African apes, and its knees and ankles were adapted to bear weight.

Choose the best answer for each question.<\/b><\/span><br><br>Madelaine B\u00f6hme, a researcher at the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany, unearthed the partial skeleton of an ancient ape at the Hammerschmiede clay pit in Bavaria, she knew she was looking at something special. Compared to fragments, an intact partial skeleton can tell paleoanthropologists about a creature\u2019s body proportions and how its anatomy might have functioned. A relative newcomer to the field and a paleoclimatologist by trade, B\u00f6hme enlisted Begun\u2019s expertise in analysing the fossil ape.<br><br>B\u00f6hme and colleagues determined that the bones they found came from a dryopithecine ape, an extinct ancestor of humans and great apes that once lived in the Miocene epoch. The fossils are approximately 11.6 million years old and came from at least four individual apes, including one partial skeleton. The team described the newfound ancestor, named Danuvius Guggemos, in a study published in Nature.<br><br>D. Guggemos was likely a small primate about the size of the baboon, with long arms like a bonobo. The creature had flexible elbows and strong hands capable of grasping, which suggests that it could have swung from tree to tree like a great modern ape. Nevertheless, the similarities with known apes stop there. The animal\u2019s lower limbs have much more in common with human anatomy. With extended hips and knees, D. Guggemos was capable of standing with a straighter posture than that of living African apes, and its knees and ankles were adapted to bear weight. The animal\u2019s locomotion would have therefore shared similarities with both human and ape movement, and D. Guggemos may have been able to navigate the forest by swinging from tree limbs and walking on two legs.<br><br>No one had previously heard of this hybrid form of locomotion, which B\u00f6hme and colleagues dubbed \u2018extended limb clambering\u2019. Begun says, before this discovery, scientists in the field used models of motion employed by living quadruped primates to inform how our early ancestors may have moved. \u201cHere, we have something that does not exist today,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is new and different, and you could not imagine it. It would have been silly even to suggest it unless you found fossils that told you that there was an animal like this.\u201d<br><br>Unlike great suspensory apes that favour their forelimbs and bipedal hominins, which prefer their hind limbs, the anatomy of D. Guggemos indicates that the ancient primate used both sets of limbs equally. The curvature of the big toe suggests that this animal would have been able to walk flat-footed on branches, using its longest toe to grasp and balance.<br><br>\u201cOur last common ancestor with great apes does not look like a chimp or any great living ape\u2014he may have looked like Danuvius,\u201d B\u00f6hme says.<br><br>D. Guggemos puts bipedality on the evolutionary timeline far earlier than scientists previously expected. Jeremy DeSilva, a paleoanthropologist who reviewed the study for Nature, says, while this discovery sheds some light on how hominids began to walk on two feet, it also raises new questions about the evolution of locomotion. Rather than humans evolving to become bipedal after splitting from a quadruped ancestor, the great apes must have evolved from a creature with bipedal capabilities.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">Refer to the last two paragraphs: \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Our last common ancestor with great apes does not look like a chimp or any great living ape\u2014he may have looked like Danuvius,\u201d and&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Rather than humans evolving to become bipedal after splitting from a quadruped ancestor, the great apes must have evolved from a creature with bipedal capabilities.\u201d Hence, they are the ancestors of great apes \u2013 from whom the human species evolved.

Choose the best answer for each question.<\/b><\/span><br><br>Like London's antiquated black cabs and ungainly double-decker buses, America's yellow school buses have endured, while many other forms of transportation have seen dramatic changes. That is due, in large part, to the school bus's astonishing record on safety. Frank Cyr said, \"The most often asked question [during the 1939 conference] was, 'Will this standard improve safety?'\" School-bus colour was just one of 44 standards the conferees voted on in 1939. Others included \"body lengths, ceiling heights, door specifications, and aisle widths.\" These and other standards have evolved over the years, with a constant focus on improved safety. The last significant structural changes came in 1977, according to Ron Kinney of the National Association for Pupil Transportation (NAPT). Interviewed for this article, he said, \"In 1977, the Feds came out with major changes to the bus itself, to the fuel tank, to integrity, to the seating requirements, to rollover protection.\" Those new standards also provided for wheelchair-equipped buses and other disability-related access on conventional school buses. These and other updates over the years have paid off. The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration (NHTSA) calls the school bus \"the safest vehicle on the road.\"<br><br>The school bus transportation system is the most extensive mass transit system in the United States, yet school buses account for less than one per cent of traffic fatalities each year. Students on school buses, NHTSA says, are 70 times safer than those who travel to school by car \"because [school buses] are the most regulated vehicles on the road; they are designed to be safer than passenger vehicles; in every state, stop-arm laws (referring to the mechanical stop-sign arm that swings from the side of the bus when stopped) protect children from other motorists.\" Kinney, says, \"If you look at fatalities, it is not the occupants of the school bus that have fatal injuries, it is the people that run into the school bus.\"<br><br>Just as features of the bus have evolved over the years, so has the country around it, and in some cases, the yellow school bus itself has become a powerful representation of education and access in American history. The cases collectively known as Brown v. Board of Education, in which the Supreme Court decision struck down \"separate but equal\" public education in America, started with a demand from black parents in Clarendon County, South Carolina, that their local school district provide a school bus for their kids. President Jimmy Carter started his political career on the Sumter County, Georgia, school board where his first principal act in 1955\u2014one year after Brown\u2014was to advocate for school buses for black schoolchildren. In a 2019 podcast, Carter said that when the Georgia state school board agreed to provide buses, \"The legislature ordained that the buses loaded with African-American children had to have their front two fenders painted black. They wanted everybody to know that a bus was hauling black kids instead of white kids.\" Twenty years later, in the 1970s, when a federal judge in Boston ordered the desegregation of that city's schools, yellow school buses were the vehicle of change.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span>The phrase \u2018vehicle for change\u2019 refers to&nbsp;<\/span><span>something used to achieve an end.&nbsp;<\/span><span>The correct answer is (4) because differently coloured buses for different sections of society would mean national disintegration.
