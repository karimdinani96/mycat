As a well-known comedic actress, Friganza was best known for playing larger-than-life characters, including Caroline Vokes in The Orchid and Mrs Radcliffe in The Sweetest Girl in Paris. Off the stage, she was an influential and prominent suffragist who advocated for women's social and political equality. The early 1900s were a critical time in the fight for the vote: members of the Women's Progressive Suffrage Union held the first suffrage march in the United States in New York City in 1908, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was established in 1909 to fight for voting rights of people of colour, and in 1910, 10,000 people gathered in New York City's Union Square for what was then the largest demonstration in support of women's suffrage in American history.\r<br>\r<br>Friganza, an unflinching supporter in the fight for the ballot, was a vital presence in a movement that needed to draw young, dynamic women into the cause. She attended rallies in support of women's right to vote, gave speeches to gathering crowds, and donated generously to suffrage organisations. \"I do not believe any man \u2013 at least no man I know \u2013 is better fitted to form a political opinion than I am,\" Friganza declared at a suffrage rally in New York City in 1908. \r<br>\r<br>\"Trixie was one of the major suffragists,\" says Susan Clermont, senior music specialist at the Library of Congress. \"She was one of those women with her banner and her hat and her white dress, and she was a real force to be reckoned with for women's rights.\" In 1907, Friganza's two worlds\u2014celebrity and activism\u2014would collide when she began a romantic relationship with Jack Norworth.\r<br>\r<br>Norworth, a well-known vaudeville performer and songwriter in his own right, was married to actress Louise Dresser when he met Friganza. (When news of the wedded couple's separation hit the press, Dresser announced that her husband was leaving her for the rival vaudeville star.) The affair was at its peak in 1908 when Norworth, riding the subway alone on an early spring day through New York City, noticed a sign that read \"Baseball Today\u2014Polo Grounds\" and hastily wrote the lyrics of what would become \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" on the back of an envelope.

An increase in ethnic density may help decrease the distress of the individual in this situation, especially by providing a social support system. &hellip; Cultural bereavement may also be minimized if the immigrant is able to maintain ties to the culture of origin, either through increased ethnic density, improved social support or maintenance of religious beliefs and practice. On the other hand, individuals who migrate from a predominately socio-centric culture into a society that is predominately egocentric in nature may experience little in the way of problems, and a relatively easy transition to the new culture, if the person who has migrated is mostly egocentric, or individualistic, in his\/her outlook.

In the mid-1800s, inspired by recent advances in communications, the German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz compared the brain to a telegraph.<br \/><br \/>The mathematician John von Neumann stated flatly that the function of the human nervous system is &lsquo;prima facie digital&rsquo;, drawing parallel after parallel between the components of the computing machines of the day and the components of the human brain. Each metaphor reflected the most advanced thinking of the era that spawned it. Predictably, just a few years after the dawn of computer technology in the 1940s, the brain was said to operate like a computer, with the role of physical hardware played by the brain itself and our thoughts serving as software. Propelled by subsequent advances in both computer technology and brain research, an ambitious multidisciplinary effort to understand human intelligence gradually developed, firmly rooted in the idea that humans are, like computers.<\/p>","PassageTitle":"q10-13","IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Option 1:<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"><b>&nbsp;<\/b><\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Each of the metaphors chosen \u2014 from hydraulic machinery to machines, to the telegraph, to the computer \u2014\u00a0reflected a major advance that had a huge impact on human life, dramatically transforming it, thus capturing the imagination of the thinkers of the time.\u00a0Option 2: It is not mentioned in the passage that each of the thinkers had a role to play in the scientific advances of their time.

That means, 4 friends like one of Hockey and Tennis and the other likes 3.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 14.7px;\">Now, from table 2, only one friend likes both Chess and Cricket. Also, from Table 2, only one friend likes both Cricket and Hockey &amp; Cricket and Tennis. We have seen that one of B and D likes all the 4 games and the other likes 3 games. If the other friend (who likes 3 games) likes Cricket, that friend cannot like Chess or Hockey or Tennis (from Table 2). That means, the other friend cannot like 3 games. Therefore, we conclude that the other friend (who likes 3 games) likes all games except Cricket.<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 14.7px;\"> Also exactly one friend likes cricket and that is either B or D<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 14.7px;\">.
