Choose the best answer for each question.<\/b><\/span><br><br>Prairie dogs are not big and charismatic like bison, grizzly bears or pandas, but they are just as important and perhaps even more controversial. The cause for their controversy is the same reason that they are so important: these burrowing rodents make a unique and significant impact on the prairie landscape.<br><br>Like humans, prairie dogs live in huge colonies composed of countless small family groups, called coteries. They are prolific diggers, constructing complex burrow systems with specific areas for sleeping, nursing young, storing food and even disposing of their dead. A single colony\u2019s burrow system can cover thousands of acres, with an average of about 20 prairie dogs per acre in the summer after the young emerge. That\u2019s why these burrow systems are sometimes called prairie dog towns.<br><br>Moreover, they house more than just prairie dogs. Critically endangered black-footed ferrets eat prairie dogs (almost exclusively) and are not found outside of prairie dog towns. Desert cottontail rabbits, prairie rattlesnakes, barred tiger salamanders, plains spadefoot toads, camel spiders, innumerable insects, and other animals that cannot dig on their own also live in prairie dog burrows. Some species occupy active burrows while others, such as burrowing owls, find shelter in abandoned areas.<br><br>But life has been tough for prairie dogs over the last 200 years or so. Just as huge herds of bison once roamed the plains, prairie dogs used to live on enormous swaths of grassland in numbers more like cities than towns. Naturalist Vernon Bailey once described an enormous prairie dog town that in 1901 spanned nearly 25,000 square miles across central Texas and contained an estimated 400 million prairie dogs!<br><br>Prairie dogs transform the landscape through digging and grazing, and in those numbers, it is easy to see why early European colonists saw them as a destructive force. The colonisation of the West led to the prairie dog\u2019s current conservation predicament. The conversion of prairie to farms destroyed their habitat, and systematic poisonings removed colonies from land set aside for cattle. Over time, prairie dog numbers dropped by more than 95%. Their story represents more than just the loss of one species; it also accelerated the decline of the suite of species supported by prairie dog engineering.<br><br>Prairie dogs do not only change their environment by digging burrows. With the diligence of a greenskeeper at a golf club, they also keep the lawns around their colonies neatly trimmed. They constantly graze on grasses and clip other plants to the ground, both to eat and to maintain a clear view of potential predators in all directions. When they spot a predator sneaking up <span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">\u2014<\/span> whether it<span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\"> i<\/span>s a badger on the ground or a ferruginous hawk in the air <span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">\u2014<\/span> they immediately sound the alarm by repeatedly <span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">\u201c<\/span>yipping<span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">\u201d<\/span> to warn their neighbours about the threat. Prairie dog landscaping incidentally creates another unique habitat for other wildlife. Birds that live in short-grass habitats often prefer prairie dog towns to similar areas without them.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"The correct answer is (4) because it is a fact that human population has risen sharply in the last few centuries contrary to the population of prairie dogs which has decreased.
