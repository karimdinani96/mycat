Choose the best answer for each question.<\/b>\r<br>\r<br>In Queens, a guy working in his garage churned out \u201cPollocks\u201d and \u201cRothkos\u201d that fooled the experts, sold for millions of dollars and helped destroy the Knoedler & Company gallery. Our first instinct is to lament their misdeeds. But while forgery is very clearly an economic crime, it may not always be an artistic or aesthetic one. Forgers can even be an art lover\u2019s friend.\r<br>\r<br>Forgers also remind us that great art depends on the ideas of artists, not necessarily on their actual hands. Many wonderful works of art by figures such as Titian and Rembrandt were executed partly or even mostly by their\u00a0studio assistants, which doesn\u2019t make them any less expressive of Titian or Rembrandt\u2019s innovations. For nearly two decades, our forger in Queens managed to fool both the dealers at Knoedler and their art-savvy clients, and the only reason his countless fakes could exist and succeed is because the true achievement of Pollock and Rothko was to come up with a set of ideas and procedures for making art. The faker could be considered a faithful assistant of theirs who happened to arrive after they\u2019d died.\r<br>\r<br>We may also want to bless forgers for helping to tame our absurd art market. If speculators eventually are scared off by the\u00a0danger of being stuck with fakes, prices\u00a0may fall. In a market depressed and made anxious by fakes, investors and private collectors may start pulling out, leaving more room for museums to buy at prices they can afford, which in turn would be good news for any art lover who depends on public collections. And, since museums don\u2019t have to think about net worth and reselling, they can live with the risk of maybe having bought a fake. Their audience might still enjoy and learn from the new \u201cRothko\u201d in the collection.\r<br>\r<br>An essay by Alexander Nagel, a professor at the Institute of Fine Arts in New York, argues that \u201cforgery\u201d is a concept that barely existed in Western art before around 1500, when the art market was invented and a new cast of players who came to be known as \u201cdealers,\u201d \u201ccollectors,\u201d \u201cconnoisseurs\u201d \u2014 and forgers \u2014 was born. Before that a copy could stand in perfectly well for an earlier work of art, so long as it transmitted the same \u201cessential content,\u201d as Mr. Nagel puts it, and could fill the same religious or commemorative functions. When a great Byzantine icon was copied, the new version was felt to have the same relationship to its divine subject as the older one, and so could do the same cultural work. What would it mean to \u201cforge\u201d a picture, in a world where originals and copies could be interchanged?\r<br>\r<br>Some of the 20<sup>th<\/sup> century\u2019s most important creators like Andy Warhol was famously freewheeling when it came to notions of authenticity: You could never tell, and weren\u2019t supposed to know, how much if any of a Warhol painting had actually been made by him versus by some acolyte in his art Factory. The art market can\u2019t stand the slippages such ideas introduce, and insists on selling Warhols the way you\u2019d sell a Lincoln autograph. Forgers, on the other hand, help preserve modern art\u2019s productive uncertainty.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span>Refer to the last paragraph: \u201cAndy Warhol was famously freewheeling when it came to notions of authenticity: You could never tell, and weren\u2019t supposed to know, how much if any of a Warhol painting had actually been made by him versus by some acolyte in his art Factory.\u201d Options 1, 2 and 3 are unaccounted for.

When Pandora\u2019s Box was opened, it unleashed swarms of diseases and disasters upon humankind.<br><br>Today we can no longer ignore the ecological curses that we have released in our search for warmth and comfort. In engineering and exploiting and transforming our habitat, we have opened tens of thousands of Pandora\u2019s boxes. In recent decades, environmental threats have expanded beyond regional boundaries to have global reach and, most hauntingly, are multiplying at a dizzying rate. Stories of accelerated catastrophe, apocalypse and collapse, multiply. We fear the breakdown of the electric grid, the end of non-renewable resources, the expansion of deserts, the loss of islands, and the pollution of our air and water.<br><br>Acceleration is the signature of our time. Populations and economic activity grew slowly for much of human history. For thousands of years and well into early modern times, world economies saw no growth at all, but from around the mid-19th century and again, in particular, since the mid-20th, the real GDP has increased at an enormous speed, and so has human consumption. In the Middle Ages, households in Central Europe might have owned fewer than 30 objects on average; in 1900, this number had increased to 400, and in 2020 to 15,000. The acceleration of human production, consumption and travel has changed the biotic and abiotic spheres. It has reverberated through natural processes on which humans depend. Species extinction, deforestation, damming of rivers, the occurrence of floods, the depletion of ozone, the ecological degradation of ocean systems and many other areas are all experiencing acceleration. If represented graphically, the curve for all these changes looks somewhat like that well-known hockey stick: with little change over millennia and a dramatic upswing over the past decades.<br><br>The fact that we now imagine our planet as a whole does not mean that the \u2018rescue\u2019 of our planet will come with one big global stroke of genius and technology. It will more likely come by many small acts. Global heating and environmental degradation are not technological problems. They are highly political issues that are informed by powerful interests. <br><br>We need to find ways that help us flatten the hockey-stick curves that reflect our ever-faster pace of ecological destruction and social acceleration. If we acknowledge that human manipulation of the Earth has been a destructive force that has caused substantial converging threats, we can also imagine that human endeavours can help us build a less destructive world in the centuries to come. We might keep making mistakes. However, we will also keep learning from our mistakes.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span>Option 2 is an unlikely answer because the author does not suggest that merely acknowledging&nbsp;<\/span><span>the problems&nbsp;<\/span><span>would mitigate&nbsp;<\/span><span>them<\/span><span>.

They found that the rats\u2019 vocalisations more than doubled during tickling, and that rats bonded with the ticklers, approaching them more frequently for social play. Through his research, Dr. Panksepp identified neural circuits for seven emotions common among mammals from humans to rats. The positive emotions included seeking, lust, care and play; the negative ones were rage, fear and panic.

Follow-up studies found that rats would press a lever to lower a rat who was suspended from a harness; that they would refuse to walk down a path in a maze if it resulted in a shock delivered to another rat; and that rats who had been shocked themselves were less likely to allow other rats to be shocked, having been through the discomfort themselves. <br><br>Nevertheless, the discovery of rat empathy was also met with incredulity.

Choose the best answer for each question. <\/b><br><br>In the late 1990s, Jaak Panksepp, the father of affective neuroscience, discovered that rats laugh. This fact had remained hidden because rats laugh in ultrasonic chirps that we can\u2019t hear. It was only when Brian Knutson, a member of Panksepp\u2019s lab, started to monitor their vocalisations during social play that he realised there was something that appeared unexpectedly similar to human laughter. Panksepp and his team began to systematically study this phenomenon by tickling the rats and measuring their response. They found that the rats\u2019 vocalisations more than doubled during tickling, and that rats bonded with the ticklers, approaching them more frequently for social play. Through his research, Dr. Panksepp identified neural circuits for seven emotions common among mammals from humans to rats. The positive emotions included seeking, lust, care and play; the negative ones were rage, fear and panic. He captured the popular imagination in part through what he described as a \u201ccross-species friendship\u201d with the lab rats.<br><br>The rats were enjoying themselves. However, the discovery was met with opposition from the scientific community. The world was not ready for laughing rats.<br><br>That discovery was just the tip of the iceberg. We now know that rats do not live merely in the present, but are capable of reliving memories of past experiences and mentally planning the navigation route they will later follow. They reciprocally trade different kinds of goods with each other \u2013 and understand not only when they owe a favour to another rat, but also that the favour can be paid back in a different currency. When they make the wrong choice, they display something that appears very close to regret. Despite having brains that are much simpler than humans\u2019, there are some learning tasks in which they will likely outperform you. Rats can be taught cognitively demanding skills, such as driving a vehicle to reach the desired goal, playing hide-and-seek with a human, and using the appropriate tool to access out-of-reach food.<br><br>The most unexpected discovery, however, was that rats are capable of empathy. Since the 1950s and \u201960s, behavioural studies have consistently shown that rats are far from the egoistic, self-centred creatures that their popular image suggests. It all began with a study in which the rats refused to press a lever to obtain food when that lever also delivered a shock to a fellow rat in an adjacent cage. The rats would rather starve than witness a rat suffering. Follow-up studies found that rats would press a lever to lower a rat who was suspended from a harness; that they would refuse to walk down a path in a maze if it resulted in a shock delivered to another rat; and that rats who had been shocked themselves were less likely to allow other rats to be shocked, having been through the discomfort themselves. <br><br>Nevertheless, the discovery of rat empathy was also met with incredulity. How could a rat be empathic? Surely, there must have been something wrong with the experimental procedures. So the rat empathy research programme languished for some 50 years.

That means they lay their eggs in the nests of other birds, leaving all the hard work of incubating the eggs and feeding the chicks to somebody else. Luckily, many of those other species have evolved some anti-parasitic defenses. Yellow warblers, for example, produce a certain type of call to warn other warblers about nearby cowbirds.  The yellow warblers' seet call is called a \"referential alarm call,\" because it is only produced for a single threat, the brown-headed cowbird. And in response to the seet call, the female yellow warbler, instead of attacking or mobbing the cowbird, she sneaks back to her nest and sits on it tightly so as to prevent the cowbird from being able to lay a parasitic egg. Red-winged blackbirds, which sometimes nest near warblers, do not produce referential alarm calls. But it turns out that they can eavesdrop on the yellow warblers' calls.
