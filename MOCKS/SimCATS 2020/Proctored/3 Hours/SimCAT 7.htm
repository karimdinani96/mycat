Option 3 is also deficient in implying that the public can put capitalism back under control merely through monitoring it. Options 1 and 4 are possible answers; however, option 4 is a better answer because option 1 states \u2018successor to communism\u2019\u2014 this is not implied in the passage.

On its own terms, \u201creally existing socialism\u201d was a miserable failure: brutally repressive to its own peoples and ultimately unable to compete with capitalist economies. Yet it achieved something else that its own politburos and planners never intended - an achievement that represents one of our era\u2019s greatest paradoxes. Communism did not topple capitalism, but kept it honest \u2013 and so saved it from itself.\r<br>\r<br>The very presence of a powerful rival ideology frightened capitalists into sharing their returns with workers and the rest of the society. By sending tanks into Prague in 1968, Leonid Brezhnev may have crushed the dream of \u201csocialism with a human face\u201d; but he and other Soviet general secretaries forced capitalism to become less inhumane. Conversely, the collapse of communism between 1989 and 1991 has left capitalism unchallenged \u2013 and increasingly unviable. \r<br>\r<br>From the very outset, November 1989 was framed as the moment when capitalism could stop battling for survival and finally renew itself. The leading newspapers summed up liberal hopes: \u201cThe wealth is at last available not only to tackle long-neglected evils at home, but to pay for a genuine fight against poverty, injustices and ecological disaster in the rest of the world.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>It has not panned out like that. Indeed, for most of the past three decades, the political classes \u2013 whether Tony Blair or David Cameron, George W Bush or Barack Obama \u2013 have accepted vast gulfs between rich and poor as just one of those sad facts of life. With tiny shrugs, they put it down to globalisation or the shifting job market \u2013 and deploy the work of top economists who argue that income inequality has been a natural by-product of technological innovation.\r<br>\r<br>Yet history supplies very different testimony. It shows how the existential threat to capitalism posed by socialist movements, whether revolutionary communist or reformist social democrat, rebalanced power towards workers. The starkest example is the eight-hour working day. Demanded for more than a century by socialists such as Robert Owen, it had been the rallying cry of the annual May Day demonstrations organised since 1890 \u2013 yet it took the Bolshevik revolution of October 1917 and the concurrent unrest of workers across Europe to make it law within months in France, Germany and Portugal.\r<br>\r<br>The manner in which socialism reformed capitalism is made explicit in a paper from the International Labour Organisation that notes how the surge in inequality across the west in the 19thC was reversed \u201cas the threat of the spread of communism inspired welfarist redistributive reforms, giving capitalism a more human face\u201d. In 1929, the richest 0.1% of Americans owned almost 25% of all the nation\u2019s household wealth; by the 70s, that had dropped below 10%.\r<br>\r<br>Almost all such counterweights to extreme capitalism have disappeared today, from strong trade unions to alternative national models. The resulting debauchery is all around us, from the companies that shovel money towards their shareholders while sending their workers to food banks, to the billionaires now preparing to run for US president. The challenge for this century will be whether we can build a new political movement to scare the capitalists silly, so as to force them to come to their senses.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span>Option 1 is incorrect. \u201cI come not to bury communism but to praise it \u2013 or rather, one aspect of it that gets next to no recognition,\u201d does not mean the author is a communist\u2014 he acknowledges that communism is a failed ideology, but believes that it was useful in containing extreme capitalism.

In particular, research over the past 5 years has provided exciting evidence for the influence of dietary factors on specific molecular systems and mechanisms that maintain mental function. For instance, a diet that is rich in omega-3 fatty acids is garnering appreciation for supporting cognitive processes in humans and upregulating genes&nbsp;<\/span>(production)&nbsp;that are important for maintaining synaptic function and plasticity in rodents. In turn, diets that are high in saturated fat are becoming notorious for reducing molecular substrates that support cognitive processing and increasing the risk of neurological dysfunction in both humans and animals. Although these studies emphasize an important effect of food on the brain, further work is necessary to determine the mechanisms of action and the conditions for therapeutic applications in humans.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Over thousands of years, diet, in conjunction with other aspects of daily living, such as exercise, has had a crucial role in shaping cognitive capacity and brain evolution. Advances in molecular biology have revealed the ability of food-derived signals to influence energy metabolism and synaptic plasticity and, thus, mediate the effects of food on cognitive function, which is likely to have been crucial for the evolution of the modern brain. Feeding habits have been intrinsically associated with the development of human civilization, as people&rsquo;s choice of what to eat is influenced by culture, religion and society. The newly discovered effects of food on cognition are intriguing for the general public, as they might challenge preconceptions, and they attract substantial interest from the media. The fact that feeding is an intrinsic human routine emphasizes the power of dietary factors to modulate mental health not only at the individual level, but also at the collective, population-wide level. Here I discuss the effects of both internal signals that are associated with feeding and dietary factors on cell metabolism, synaptic plasticity and mental function. I use the term cognition from a neurobiological perspective, to refer to the mental processes that are involved in acquiring knowledge and to the integration of these processes into the conscious aspect of emotions, which influences mood and has psychiatric manifestations.<br \/><br \/>Adaptations that facilitated food acquisition and energy efficiency exerted strong evolutionary pressures on the formation of the modern brain and the energy-demanding development of cognitive skills. For example, the wildebeest annually travels hundreds of miles to find feeding grounds in the savannah, a behaviour that requires fully operational and complex navigational, defensive and cognitive conducts for survival. The function of brain centres that control eating behaviour is integrated with those of centres that control cognition. For instance, animals that eat a potentially poisonous meal develop a perpetual aversion to its flavour through complex mechanisms of learning and memory that involve the hypothalamus, the hippocampus and the amygdala. In turn, pleasant memories of foods have been related to brain pathways that are associated with reward.<\/p>","PassageTitle":"q16-20","IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin; color: black;\">The first paragraph spells out the theme about the influence of food on the brain: &rdquo;&hellip;<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">&nbsp;its ability to prevent and protect against diseases is starting to be recognized.

Advances in molecular biology have revealed the ability of food-derived signals to influence energy metabolism and synaptic plasticity and, thus, mediate the effects of food on cognitive function, which is likely to have been crucial for the evolution of the modern brain. Feeding habits have been intrinsically associated with the development of human civilization, as people&rsquo;s choice of what to eat is influenced by culture, religion and society.

The fact that feeding is an intrinsic human routine emphasizes the power of dietary factors to modulate mental health not only at the individual level, but also at the collective, population-wide level.
