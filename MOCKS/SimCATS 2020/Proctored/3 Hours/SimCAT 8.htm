InThe Wealth of Nations, he describes an imaginary scenario in which a baker living before the invention of money wanted a butcher&rsquo;s meat but had nothing the butcher wanted. This sort of scenario was so undesirable that societies must have created money to facilitate trade, argues Smith. <br \/><br \/>But anthropologists have pointed out that barter economy has never been witnessed anywhere. When barter has appeared, it wasn&rsquo;t as part of a purely barter economy, and money didn&rsquo;t emerge from it&mdash;rather, it emerged from money. After Rome fell, for instance, Europeans used barter as a substitute for the Roman currency people had gotten used to. &ldquo;In most of the cases we know about, [barter] takes place between people who are familiar with the use of money, but for one reason or another, don&rsquo;t have a lot of it around,&rdquo; explains David Graeber in Debt: The First 5,000 Years. <br \/><br \/>So if barter never existed, what did? Anthropologists describe a variety of methods of exchange. Communities of Iroquois Native Americans, for instance, stockpiled their goods in longhouses. Female councils then allocated the goods. Other indigenous communities relied on &ldquo;gift economies,&rdquo; which went something like this: If you were a baker who needed meat, you didn&rsquo;t offer your bagels for the butcher&rsquo;s steaks. Instead, you got your wife to hint to the butcher&rsquo;s wife that you two were low on iron, and she&rsquo;d say something like &ldquo;Oh really?

Choose the best answer for each question.<\/strong><\/span> <br \/><br \/>The man who arguably founded modern economic theory, the 18<sup>th<\/sup> century philosopher Adam Smith, popularized the idea that barter was a precursor to money. InThe Wealth of Nations, he describes an imaginary scenario in which a baker living before the invention of money wanted a butcher&rsquo;s meat but had nothing the butcher wanted. This sort of scenario was so undesirable that societies must have created money to facilitate trade, argues Smith. <br \/><br \/>But anthropologists have pointed out that barter economy has never been witnessed anywhere. When barter has appeared, it wasn&rsquo;t as part of a purely barter economy, and money didn&rsquo;t emerge from it&mdash;rather, it emerged from money. After Rome fell, for instance, Europeans used barter as a substitute for the Roman currency people had gotten used to. &ldquo;In most of the cases we know about, [barter] takes place between people who are familiar with the use of money, but for one reason or another, don&rsquo;t have a lot of it around,&rdquo; explains David Graeber in Debt: The First 5,000 Years. <br \/><br \/>So if barter never existed, what did? Anthropologists describe a variety of methods of exchange. Communities of Iroquois Native Americans, for instance, stockpiled their goods in longhouses. Female councils then allocated the goods. Other indigenous communities relied on &ldquo;gift economies,&rdquo; which went something like this: If you were a baker who needed meat, you didn&rsquo;t offer your bagels for the butcher&rsquo;s steaks. Instead, you got your wife to hint to the butcher&rsquo;s wife that you two were low on iron, and she&rsquo;d say something like &ldquo;Oh really? Have a hamburger, we&rsquo;ve got plenty!&rdquo; Down the line, the butcher might want a birthday cake, or help moving to a new apartment. <br \/><br \/>However, no academics were aware of any evidence that barter was actually the precursor to money. Some argue that no one ever believed barter was real to begin with. However, the idea is incredibly widespread. And this isn&rsquo;t just an academic curiosity&mdash;the idea of barter may have altered history. &ldquo;The vision of the world that forms the basis of the economics textbooks &hellip; has by now become so much a part of our common sense that we find it hard to imagine any other possible arrangement,&rdquo; writes Graeber. <br \/><br \/>Graeber asserts that the barter myth implies humans have always had a sort of quid pro quo, exchange-based mentality, since barter is just a less efficient version of money. But if you consider that other, completely different systems existed, then money starts to look like less of a natural outgrowth of human nature, and more of a choice. <br \/><br \/>For one thing, the barter myth &ldquo;makes it possible to imagine a world that is nothing more than a series of cold-blooded calculations,&rdquo; writes Graeber. This view is quite common now, even when behavioral economists have made a convincing case that humans are much more complicated&mdash;and less rational&mdash;than classical economic models would suggest. <br \/><br \/>So if money is a choice, are there alternatives worth considering? Is a gift economy which relies on communal responsibility and trust preferable to a system based on money? &hellip; But it&rsquo;s one thing to keep a community alive and well &hellip; quite another to imagine a gift economy enabling humans to build skyscrapers, invent iPhones, and explore space.<\/p>","PassageTitle":"q1-5","IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<p>The main argument in the passage is that &ldquo;barter (economy) never existed,&rdquo; and that barter as a precursor to money is a myth.

Option 2 will support the argument of the author that other forms of exchange than money or barter existed. Option 3 does the same. Option 4 attacks anthropologists, and not the argument.

However, according to the Greenpeace Report, in 2007, India generated 3,80,000 tonnes of e-waste. Only 3% of this made it to the authorised recyclers\u2019 facilities. One of the reasons for this is, India has also become a dumping ground for many developed nations. The Basel Action Network (BAN) stated in a report that 50-80% of e-waste collected by the USA is exported to India, China, Pakistan, Taiwan, and several African countries. India is one of the fastest-growing economies of the world, and the domestic demand for consumer durables has been skyrocketing. From 1998 to 2002, there was a 53.1% increase in the sales of domestic household appliances, both large and small all over the world. Another report estimated that in India, business and individual households make approximately 1.38 million personal computers obsolete every year, accelerating the rate of e-waste generation, which is around 10%, annually going to affect environmental health indicators.<br><br>Electronic equipment contains many hazardous metallic contaminants such as lead, cadmium, and beryllium and brominated flame-retardants. The fraction including iron, copper, aluminium, gold, and other metals in e-waste is over 60%, while plastics account for about 30% and the hazardous pollutants comprise only about 2.70%. Of many toxic heavy metals, lead is the most widely used in electronic devices for various purposes, resulting in a variety of health hazards due to environmental contamination. Lead enters biological systems via food, water, air, and soil. Children are particularly vulnerable to lead poisoning \u2013 more so than adults because they absorb more lead from their environment and their nervous system and blood gets affected. It is found that the e-waste recycling activities had contributed to the elevated blood lead levels in children living in China, which is one of the popular destinations of e-waste. This was due to that fact that the processes and techniques used during the recycling activities were very primitive.

While research indicates possible links between light exposure in workplaces and workers' productivity and performance, less is known about the role of workplace light exposure on workers' quality of life and sleep quality. <br><br>Office workers with more light exposure at the workplace tended to have longer sleep duration, better sleep quality, more physical activity, and better quality of life compared to office workers with less light exposure at the workplace. Office workers' physical and mental well-being may be improved via enhanced indoor lighting for those with insufficient daylight in current offices as well as increased emphasis on light exposure in the design of future offices.<br><br>There is much evidence that links insufficient sleep and\/ or reduced sleep quality to a range of significant short-term impairments such as memory loss, slower psychomotor reflexes, and diminished attention. If windowless environments or lack of daylight affect office workers' sleep quality, there will be subsequent effects not only individually but also on a societal level, leading to more accidents, workplace errors, and decreased productivity. Sleep quality is also an important health indicator that may have effects on, and interactions with mood, cognitive performance, and health outcomes such as diabetes and other illnesses. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the effects of daylight as it may provide a profound way to improve office workers' productivity and health as well as the safety of the community they work and live in. Deprivation to light damages monoamine neurons and produces a depressive behavioural phenotype in rats. In humans, a direct correlation between the severity level of seasonal affective disorder and exposure to natural light is well documented. Results of several studies suggest that both natural and artificial bright light, particularly in the morning, can significantly improve health outcomes such as depression, agitation, sleep, circadian rest-activity, and seasonal affective disorder.<br><br>These effects of light exposure, or the lack thereof, illustrate the importance of proper light exposure for physical well-being and mental health. In our modern society, many responsibilities at the workplace and at home dictate self-imposed alterations and\/or loss of daylight in our daily lives. Findings from the previously discussed research suggest that the light exposure determined by our daily schedules will have subsequent consequences on our mood, cognitive performance, and overall well-being. However, studies exploring the impact of daylight exposure, or the lack thereof, on the health of office workers are very scarce. Therefore, there is a need to examine the influence of light exposure at the workplace, through the existence or absence of windows and of daylight, on office workers' sleep patterns, physical activity, and quality of life via actigraphy and subjective measures. There ought to be a comparison between two groups of office workers\u2014those with windows and abundant levels of daylight and those without windows and with no direct contact with daylight at their workstations\u2014 in terms of overall health and well-being and subjective sleep quality using well-validated scales, and objective measures of sleep, activity levels, and light exposure via actigraphy.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<div>The correct answer is (2) because the author's idea is to draw attention to the need for more research about the role of workplace light on workers' sleep quality and quality of life.

The phenomenon came to be known as anorexia mirabilis. Considering holy women on the Italian peninsula alone, Bell notes that, between 1200 and the late-20th century, some 261 women were formally recognised in the Bibliotheca Sanctorum as, \u2018saints, blesseds, venerables, or servants of God\u2019. For around a third of that number, the historical record is too meagre to conclude eating behaviour but, according to Bell, more than half of the remaining 170 or so showed clear signs of anorexia. The lives of dozens of these women \u2013 Angela of Foligno, Colomba of Rieti, and Clare of Assisi among them \u2013 are documented in substantial detail, and they emerge as controversial and significant figures whose influence would reverberate down the years. The tombs of these medieval mystics became sites of pilgrimage, their relics were prized and venerated, and they entered the Catholic narrative as heroic role models. Believers listened awestruck as preachers recited stories of their extraordinary, apparently superhuman, devotion to God through denial of the flesh.<br><br>The most famous of the holy anorexics was Catherine of Siena (1347-80), whose life and thoughts we know in great detail both through her copious writings and through the biographical accounts of contemporaries who knew her well, most notably Raymond of Capua, her last confessor and spiritual mentor. On Raymond\u2019s account, Catherine \u2013 the daughter of a prosperous Sienese wool dyer \u2013 was unlike ordinary children. At the age of six, while out walking with her brother, she had a vision of Christ seated on an imperial throne, clothed in pontifical vestments, with John the Evangelist and the Apostles Peter and Paul at his side. She replaced childish games with prayer and meditation and would \u2018seek out hidden places and scourge her young body in secret with a special rope\u2019, encouraging other six-year-olds to join her in practice. She retreated more and more into silence.<br><br>By the age of 15, her already frugal diet was reduced to small quantities of bread and raw vegetables. Five years or so later, following the death of her father and more visions of Christ, Catherine cut out the bread, and, from her mid-20s, apparently ate \u2018nothing\u2019 other than sacramental wafers at Holy Communion. She was dead from self-starvation by the age of 33. According to Raymond, during those last years of severe starvation, not only did she have no need for food, but the very act of eating was physically unbearable. \u2018If she forced herself to eat, her body suffered extremely, her digestion would not function, and the food had to come out with an effort by the way it had gone in.\u2019 In other words, she was forcing herself to vomit, which she did by swallowing branches of fennel or other bitter herbs. Despite her frailty, she remained physically energetic to the last and, indeed, seems to have been prone to bursts of hyperactivity. In Raymond\u2019s words:  \u2018She did not know the meaning of fatigue.\u2019","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span>Options 1, 2 and 3 are true about Catherine of Siena.

Choose the best answer for each question.<\/b><\/span><br><br>The ancient Stoic philosophers like Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and Epictetus regularly conducted an exercise known as a premeditatio malorum, which translates to a \u201cpremeditation of evils.\u201d<br><br>The goal of this exercise was to envision the negative things that could happen in life. For example, the Stoics would imagine what it would be like to lose their job and become homeless, or to suffer an injury and become paralyzed, or to have their reputation ruined and lose their status in society.<br><br>The Stoics believed that by imagining the worst-case scenario ahead of time, they could overcome their fears of negative experiences and make better plans to prevent them. While most people were focused on how they could achieve success, the Stoics also considered how they would manage failure. What would things look like if everything went wrong tomorrow? And what does this tell us about how we should prepare today?<br><br>This way of thinking, in which you consider the opposite of what you want, is known as inversion. When I first learned of it, I didn't realize how powerful it could be. As I have studied it more, I have begun to realize that inversion is a rare and crucial skill that nearly all great thinkers use to their advantage. <br><br>The German mathematician Carl Jacobi made a number of important contributions to different scientific fields during his career. In particular, he was known for his ability to solve hard problems by following a strategy of man muss immer umkehren or, loosely translated, \u201cinvert, always invert.\u201d<br><br>Jacobi believed that one of the best ways to clarify your thinking was to restate math problems in inverse form. He would write down the opposite of the problem he was trying to solve and found that the solution often came to him more easily.<br><br>Inversion is a powerful thinking tool because it puts a spotlight on errors and roadblocks that are not obvious at first glance. What if the opposite was true? What if I focused on a different side of this situation? Instead of asking how to do something, ask how to not do it.<br><br>Great thinkers, icons, and innovators think forward and backward. They consider the opposite side of things. Occasionally, they drive their brain in reverse. This way of thinking can reveal compelling opportunities for innovation.<br><br>Art provides several good examples. One of the biggest musical shifts in the last several decades came from Nirvana, a band that legitimized a whole new genre of music\u2014alternative rock\u2014and whose Nevermind album is memorialized in the Library of Congress as one of the most \u201cculturally, historically or aesthetically important\u201d recordings of the 20<sup>th<\/sup> century. <br><br>Nirvana turned the conventions of mainstream rock and pop music completely upside down. Where hair metal bands like Poison and Def Leppard spent millions to produce and promote each record, Nirvana recorded Nevermind for $65,000. Where hair metal was flashy, Nirvana was stripped-down and raw. Inversion is often at the core of great art.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span>The passage has two elements: 1.&nbsp;<\/span><span>premeditatio&nbsp;<\/span><span>malorum\u2014&nbsp;<\/span><span>a focus on what can go wrong and be better prepared. 2.
