Entire books conclude that colleges have failed to increase students\u2019 critical thinking. Advocates of critical thinking contrast thinking critically with learning knowledge. College professors, they proclaim, teach facts, dates, formulae that students don\u2019t need and won\u2019t use. Instead, students need to have intellectual and cognitive skills. Often, advocates of critical thinking portray it as an independent set of cognitive skills that are easily transferable.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">At a more profound level, critical thinking can be seen as a disciplined activity on its own terms. Indeed, one might understand it as a revival of the trivium of grammar, rhetoric, and logic \u2013 the original liberal arts. The term arts meant techn\u00e9, or techniques (think of artisans) to analyse texts and problems. In this <\/span>sense, critical thinking can be understood as a deep activity, one that requires the development of new habits of mind. It cannot come without extensive study and practice. The skills that we apply to problems and texts, the capacity to understand arguments, to make sense of their strengths and weaknesses, and to offer new and creative solutions is gained by years of study. Even this more profound understanding of critical thinking cannot be separated from learning subject matter in the arts and sciences.<br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">When students graduating from Harvard College and ninth-graders at Cambridge Rindge were asked about the seasons, they demonstrated amazing levels of \u201ccritical thinking,\u201d but they did not have the background knowledge to get the correct answer. Many believed that the seasons were caused by the Earth\u2019s orbit. Some offered complicated responses that exhibited their \u201ccritical thinking\u201d and creativity. But they were wrong. If they had remembered that the seasons had to do with the Earth\u2019s tilted axis, they could have reasoned themselves to the correct answer. We can only think critically about things about which we have knowledge, and we can only make use of facts if we know how to think about them. <\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">One has to know things to answer things. This is true even in the age of Google. If one looks up something online, one needs to know a lot of background information to make sense of the definition and explanation\u2014and given how unreliable many online sources are, without that background knowledge, one might be led astray. But most surprising, those with more knowledge can learn more when they look something up on Google. That\u2019s because if they already have background knowledge, they can add to it the new information and insights from what they are learning. Someone who understands political science and has some knowledge of how parties function will learn more from an online news story about elections than someone lacking that knowledge.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">At the heart of critical thinking, therefore, must be a resolute rejection of \u201ccritical thinking\u201d in favour of enabling students to study and to master bodies of knowledge with which they can think critically\u2014whether organic chemistry or the causes and consequences of the Boxer Rebellion.

Adler considered firstborns to be neurotic, because they don\u2019t have to share their parents for years and are essentially dethroned once a sibling comes along. He also considered oldest children dutiful and sometimes conservative. According to Adler, the youngest children are ambitious, while middle children are optimally positioned in the family and are characterized by emotional stability. <\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">American psychologist Frank J. Sulloway believed that every child occupies a certain niche within the family and then uses his or her own strategies to master life. Firstborn and single children had less reason to quarrel with the status quo and identify more strongly with the worldview of their fathers and mothers. Younger siblings are less sure of their parents\u2019 view and therefore more often choose alternative paths in life. Such categorizations are popular because they\u2019re rather intuitive, and one can always find an example of the sensible big sister or the rebellious young brother in their circle of acquaintances. As such, Adler\u2019s words still appear regularly in educational guides and continue to reverberate in the minds of parents.  Furthermore, some studies confirmed the idea that sibling position can shape personality. <\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">At times, however, these investigations used questionable methods. For example, members of the same family were often asked to assess themselves in terms of extraversion, openness to experiences, conscientiousness, tolerance and neuroticism. The catch is these surveys were conducted at only one point in time. The older siblings were therefore not only born first but also simply older. It has long been known that adolescents become more conscientious as they age. This trend could account for a large part of the results. Another methodological flaw was that only one person judged his or her own personality and that of his or her siblings. This detail is important because self-perception and the perception of others can sometimes differ considerably.

During the early days of a new outbreak, when reliable data are still scarce, researchers turn to mathematical models that can predict where people who could be infected are going and how likely they are to bring the disease with them. These computational methods using statistical equations calculate the probability of individuals transmitting the illness.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Modern computational power allows these models to quickly incorporate multiple inputs, such as the disease<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arimo;color: #000000;\">\u2019<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">s ability to pass from person to person and the movement patterns of potentially infected people travelling by air and land.

By plugging in different versions of each input, however, researchers update the models as new information becomes available and compare their results to observed patterns of illness.

Choose the best answer for each question.<\/b><\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Public health efforts depend heavily on predicting how diseases like novel coronavirus, COVID-19, declared a pandemic by the WHO, spread across the globe. During the early days of a new outbreak, when reliable data are still scarce, researchers turn to mathematical models that can predict where people who could be infected are going and how likely they are to bring the disease with them. These computational methods using statistical equations calculate the probability of individuals transmitting the illness.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Modern computational power allows these models to quickly incorporate multiple inputs, such as the disease<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arimo;color: #000000;\">\u2019<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">s ability to pass from person to person and the movement patterns of potentially infected people travelling by air and land. This process sometimes involves making assumptions about unknown factors, such as an individual<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arimo;color: #000000;\">\u2019<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">s travel pattern. By plugging in different versions of each input, however, researchers update the models as new information becomes available and compare their results to observed patterns of illness. For example, if investigators want to study how closing a particular airport could affect a disease<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arimo;color: #000000;\">\u2019<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">s global spread, their computers can swiftly recalculate the risk of importing cases through other airports\u2014all the humans need to do is update the network of flight routes and international travel patterns.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">However, when working with incomplete data, a small error can have an outsize effect.

Therefore, researchers are trying to find the compensating benefits of swarming. Fitness cost could be defined as trade-offs between survival and other objectives; it is incorrect to label them \u2018disadvantageous, as option 1 does. Besides, option 1 doesn\u2019t mention the interest in the study of the phenomenon. Reject option 1. Option 2 is incorrect in saying that swarming is exclusive to birds\u2014it is found among other animals too. \u2018Long-standing mystery\u2019 (option 3) is not accounted for by the passage. It also doesn\u2019t say about the interest in the study of the phenomenon. Reject option 3. Option 4 is an apt summary.
