Choose the best answer for each question.<\/b>\r<br>\r<br>The structure of the internet is headed toward an arrangement the cyber security expert Bruce Schneier calls \u201cdigital feudalism,\u201d through which the great landlords, platforms like Google and Facebook, \u201care becoming our feudal lords, and we are becoming their vassals.\u201d We will provide them with the data-fruits of our browsing, in a nominal exchange for vague assurances of their protection from data-breach marauders. The sense of powerlessness you might already feel in the face of a mega-platform\u2019s opaque algorithmic justice \u2014 and the sense of mystery such workings might engender \u2014 would not have seemed so strange to a medieval peasant. \r<br>\r<br>And as the internet bewitches more everyday objects \u2014 smart TVs, smart ovens, smart speakers \u2014 its feudal logic will seize the material world as well. You don\u2019t \u201cown\u201d the software on your phone any more than a peasant owned his allotment, and when your car and your front-door lock are similarly enchanted, you can imagine a distant lord easily and arbitrarily evicting you \u2014 with the faceless customer-service bots to whom you\u2019d plead your case being as pitiless and unforgiving as a medieval sheriff. The Financial Times\u2019 Izabella Kaminska suggests that, within the \u201cfrightfully medieval problem\u201d of the sharing economy\u2019s quasi-feudal control of its contractors, there\u2019s \u201cpotential for the return of the guild structure\u201d: Rideshare drivers, for example, might someday create an independent credentialing body to ensure portability of data and reputation across the \u201cborders\u201d of \u201clandholders\u201d (that is, Uber and Lyft), just as craftsmen might have used a guild membership to demonstrate their credentials early in the last millennium.\r<br>\r<br>Where would this feudally arranged, spiritually charged layer of magic take our politics and culture? We could look to our president, who wields power like an absolutist king or a dodgy pope and who speaks, as many observers have noted, like a Greek hero or an Anglo-Saxon warlord \u2014 that is, in the braggadocious, highly repetitive style of the epic poetry characteristic of oral cultures.\r<br>\r<br>Paradoxically, the ephemerality \u2014 and sheer volume \u2014 of text on social media is re-creating the circumstances of a preliterate society: a world in which information is quickly forgotten and nothing can be easily looked up. (Like Irish monks copying out Aristotle, Google and Facebook will collect and sort the world\u2019s knowledge; like the medieval Catholic church, they\u2019ll rigorously control its presentation and accessibility.) Under these conditions, memorability and concision \u2014 you know, the same qualities you might say make someone good at Twitter \u2014 will be more highly prized than strength of argument, and effective political leaders, for whom the factual truth is less important than the perpetual reinscription of a durable myth, will focus on repetitive self-aggrandizement.\r<br>\r<br>All this, of course, will happen against the backdrop of disaster: a ruinous, volatile natural world, alien and unpredictable in its force and violence.

Some habit bloggers still talk about repetition as the key. They are recycling old ideas. In my research, I found that habits can form very quickly, in just a few days, when people have a strong positive emotion connected to the new behavior. In fact, some habits get wired in immediately: You do the behavior once, and then you don&rsquo;t consider other options again. When I teach people about human behavior, I boil it down to three words: Emotions create habits. What happens in your brain when you experience positive reinforcement is neuro-chemical. Good feelings spur the production of a neurotransmitter called dopamine that controls the brain&rsquo;s &ldquo;reward system&rdquo; and helps us remember what behavior led to feeling good so we will do it again. With the help of dopamine, the brain encodes the cause-and-effect relationship, and creates expectations for the future.<br \/><br \/>You can hack into this reward system by creating an event in your brain that neuroscientists call a &ldquo;reward prediction error.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s say your brain doesn&rsquo;t expect the cauliflower-crust pizza to taste good.

That&rsquo;s a &ldquo;reward prediction error.&rdquo; Your brain is constantly assessing and reassessing the experiences, sights, sounds, smells, and movements in the world around you. Based on previous experiences, your brain has formed predictions about what you will experience in any given situation. The good news is that we are not helpless when it comes to our brain chemistry. We can intentionally create feelings to wire in the habits that we actually want in our lives. When we hack into the ancient behavioral pathways in our brains, we gain access to the amazing human potential for learning and change. We have an opportunity to use the brain machinery to feel good and change behaviors. You can use many types of positive reinforcement to wire in a habit - pleasure, a sense of relief, and more&ndash; but in my research, I&rsquo;ve found that the real winner is creating a feeling of success. &hellip; Celebration is the best way to create a positive feeling that wires in your new habits. &hellip; Celebration teaches us how to be nice to ourselves &mdash; a skill that pays out the biggest dividends of all. &hellip; <br \/><br \/>The timing of the reward\/celebration matters. Scientists learned decades ago that rewards need to happen either during the behavior or milliseconds afterward. Dopamine is released and processed by the brain very quickly &hellip;. Here&rsquo;s how to help a habit root quickly and easily in your brain: Perform the behavior sequence that you want to become a habit &hellip; and then celebrate immediately. When I say that you need to celebrate immediately after the behavior, I do mean immediately. Immediacy is one piece of what informs the speed of your habit formation. The other piece is the intensity of the emotion you feel. This is a one-two punch: you&rsquo;ve got to celebrate right after the behavior, and you need your celebration to feel real.

In death, he was ritually mummified and sealed in a coffin with the inscription \u201cNesyamun, true of voice.\u201d Now, some 3,000 years into the afterlife and with the aid of a 3-D-printed vocal tract, Nesyamun can once again be heard. \u201cHe had this wish that his voice would somehow continue into perpetuity,\u201d said David Howard, a speech scientist at Royal Holloway, University of London. Dr. Howard and his team used a CT scanner to create a 3-D-printed version of Nesyamun\u2019s mouth and throat. They combined it with an electronic larynx to reconstruct \u201cthe sound that would come out of his vocal tract if he was in his coffin and his larynx came to life again,\u201d Dr. Howard said. So far the team has synthesized only a single sound from the mummy, which resembles the \u201cah\u201d and \u201ceh\u201d vowel sounds heard in the words \u201cbad\u201d and \u201cbed.\u201d <br><br>In September 2016, staff at the Leeds City Museum in England, where Nesyamun has resided for the last 200 years, wheeled the mummy to a nearby hospital to be CT scanned. The scan showed that much of his throat had remained intact.  \u201cThe actual mummification process was key here,\u201d said Joann Fletcher, an Egyptologist at the University of York in England and an author on the paper. \u201cThe superb quality of preservation achieved by the ancient embalmers meant that Nesyamun\u2019s vocal tract is still in excellent shape.\u201d Using the CT scan, the team 3-D-printed a copy of Nesyamun\u2019s vocal tract between the larynx and lips.

Choose the best answer for each question.<\/b><br><br>In life, Nesyamun was an Egyptian priest who sang and chanted words of worship at the Karnak temple in Thebes. In death, he was ritually mummified and sealed in a coffin with the inscription \u201cNesyamun, true of voice.\u201d Now, some 3,000 years into the afterlife and with the aid of a 3-D-printed vocal tract, Nesyamun can once again be heard. \u201cHe had this wish that his voice would somehow continue into perpetuity,\u201d said David Howard, a speech scientist at Royal Holloway, University of London. Dr. Howard and his team used a CT scanner to create a 3-D-printed version of Nesyamun\u2019s mouth and throat. They combined it with an electronic larynx to reconstruct \u201cthe sound that would come out of his vocal tract if he was in his coffin and his larynx came to life again,\u201d Dr. Howard said. So far the team has synthesized only a single sound from the mummy, which resembles the \u201cah\u201d and \u201ceh\u201d vowel sounds heard in the words \u201cbad\u201d and \u201cbed.\u201d <br><br>In September 2016, staff at the Leeds City Museum in England, where Nesyamun has resided for the last 200 years, wheeled the mummy to a nearby hospital to be CT scanned. The scan showed that much of his throat had remained intact.  \u201cThe actual mummification process was key here,\u201d said Joann Fletcher, an Egyptologist at the University of York in England and an author on the paper. \u201cThe superb quality of preservation achieved by the ancient embalmers meant that Nesyamun\u2019s vocal tract is still in excellent shape.\u201d Using the CT scan, the team 3-D-printed a copy of Nesyamun\u2019s vocal tract between the larynx and lips. Dr. Howard then took a loudspeaker, similar to one used on an ice cream truck, removed the horn portion and replaced it with the 3-D-printed vocal tract. He also connected the loudspeaker to a computer that enabled him to create an electronic waveform similar to what is used in common speech synthesizers. This acted as an artificial larynx. Using the computer software, he could generate a sound that would go through the loudspeaker and into the 3-D-printed vocal tract, creating the mummy\u2019s vowel sound.<br><br> \u201cHe certainly can\u2019t speak at the moment,\u201d Dr. Howard said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s perfectly plausible to suggest that one day it will be possible to produce words that are as close as we can make them to what he would have sounded like.\u201d Dr. Howard said that in the future the team could modify the computer software to approximate elements such as the size and movement of the tongue and the position of the jaw. \u201cYou can take that to its natural conclusion,\u201d said Katherine Baxter, curator of archaeology at the Leeds museum and a co-author on the paper. \u201cCould we make Nesyamun actually speak his original words as written on his coffin?\u201d If so, perhaps the mummy could recite for museum visitors his words to Nut, the ancient Egyptian goddess of the sky and heavens: \u201cO mother Nut, spread out your wings over my face so you may allow me to be like the stars-which-know-no-destruction, like the stars-which-know-no-weariness, (and) not to die over again in the cemetery.\u201d","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span>Refer to the last paragraph. \u2018\u201cYou can take that to its natural con<\/span><span>clusion,\u201d said Katherine Baxter<\/span><span> \u2026 \u201cCould we make Nesyamun actually speak his original words as written on his coffin?\u201d If so, perhaps the mummy could recite for museum visitors his words to Nut, the ancient Egyptian goddess of the sky and heavens: \u201cO mother Nut \u2026 again in the cemetery.\u201d\u2019 The<\/span><span> part following the statement throws light upon what Baxter means by \u2018natural conclusiion\u2019 of the experiment.<\/span><span> Option&nbsp;<\/span><span>1&nbsp;<\/span><span>is correct \u2013 the elementary stage at which<\/span><span> the<\/span><span> research is currently, suggests that the challenge is in recreating and listening to the voice<\/span><span> of an ancient person\u2019s voice (<\/span><span>speak his original words<\/span><span>).

Choose the best answer for each question.<\/b><br><br>An ancient legend from the Indonesian island of Flores speaks of a mysterious, wild grandmother of the forest who eats everything: the \u2018ebu gogo\u2019. According to folklore, such tiny, hairy people as her once roamed the tropical forests alongside modern humans, eating crops and sometimes even human flesh. \u2026  The legend became viewed in entirely new light, however, when the bones of an equally small, previously unknown species of human relative was discovered deep in a cave on the very same island. \u2026 Standing just over a meter tall, the hominin labeled Homo floresiensis had a small brain, the apparent ability to make arduous water crossings, and seemingly honed skills in making stone tools. \u2026  The hominin was so seemingly mythical that the research team drew from J R R Tolkien\u2019s fictional world for its nickname: the hobbit. The strangest aspect of the diminutive hominins\u2019 story was the suggestion that they roamed the tropical forests and ancient volcanoes as recently as 12,000 years ago when scientists believed that Homo sapiens were alone on the planet. It was also long after the arrival of modern humans in the area \u2013 tens of thousands of years after, in fact.<br><br>Associations between ebu gogo and H floresiensis arose immediately after the media hobbit frenzy broke. \u2026 While the media ran with the idea, some scientists, too, entertained it \u2013 fuelling hope that the legend could suggest that a living, breathing H floresiensis could still be found on some remote part of the island today.<br><br>The proposed connection between the bones and the myth raised an interesting question, one that is being explored by anthropologists: how far back in time can oral traditions accurately report events?

Similarly, the idea of the absolute value function |x &minus;&nbsp;9| is the distance of a point from x = 9. |x&nbsp;+&nbsp;1| touches the x-axis at x =&nbsp;&minus;1, |x &minus;&nbsp;5| touches the x-axis at x = 5 and |x &minus;&nbsp;9| touches the x-axis at x = 9. Thus -1, 5 and 9 are our &lsquo;anchor points&rsquo;. The meaning of the function&nbsp;|x&nbsp;+&nbsp;1|&nbsp;+&nbsp;|x &minus;&nbsp;5|&nbsp;+&nbsp;|x &minus;&nbsp;9|&nbsp;is the sum of the distances of a point from these anchor points. This distance is minimized at some value of x in this range&nbsp;&minus;1&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;x&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;9. <br \/>For any point in the range &minus;1 &le; x &le; 9, the sum of the distances of x from points x = &minus;1 and x = 9 (two extremes) is: 9 &ndash; (&minus;1) = 10. Now, we have to add the distance of x from point x = 5. If we take x = 5, the distance of that point from 5 will be zero. That means, if x = 5, the distance from point &minus;1 = 6, the distance from point 9 = 4 and the distance from point 5 = 0. Therefore, the minimum value = 6 + 4 + 0 = 10.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Therefore, the required answer is 10.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Shortcut method:<\/u><\/strong> <br \/>For such questions, identify the values of x where each of the terms individually touches the x-axis.&nbsp; <br \/>|x&nbsp;+&nbsp;1| touches the x-axis at x =&nbsp;&minus;1, |x &minus;&nbsp;5| touches the x-axis at x&nbsp;=&nbsp;5 and |x &minus;&nbsp;9| touches the x-axis at&nbsp; <br \/>x = 9. The minimum value of the sum is simply the difference between the largest value of x and the smallest value of x, where the individual terms touch the x-axis. Therefore, the minimum value of the function is 9 &ndash; (&minus;1) = 10. That means, the intermediate term |x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;5| has no influence on the minimum value of the function.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Note: This shortcut is applicable only when the number of absolute value terms in the function are 2 or 3 and there is a summation of all the terms.&nbsp;<\/p>@@@~Simcat","ItemBankID":0,"Difficulty":"Medium","DifficultyLevel":"57","ItemBank":0,"QuestionPaper":0,"IsProofRead":null,"CorrectIndex":0,"QuestionPaperSectionID":1593151366705,"IsRequiredQuestion":null,"TestID":0,"IsQuestionPackTimer":null,"ItemOptionResponse":[{"ItemOptionID":"159315290351900","ItemID":15931529035190,"Options":"<span style=\"color: #000000;\">8<\/span>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":"159315290351901","ItemID":15931529035190,"Options":"<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><\/span>\t1<span style=\"color: #000000;\">0<\/span>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":true,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":"159315290351902","ItemID":15931529035190,"Options":"13","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":"159315290351903","ItemID":15931529035190,"Options":"14","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0}],"ItemMatrixSelectedColumns":[],"ItemMatrixResponse":[],"IsPassageQuestionSplit":true,"VideoExplanation":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/435970164","PlayerMode":"VIMEO","VimeoLink":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/435970164","VimeoURI":"\/videos\/435970164","qindex":66,"qsectionindex":2,"qindexbysection":0},{"MaxWords":0,"ItemID":15931529035211,"ItemType":"mcq","SubjectName":"Mathematics","SubjectID":1588684115265,"AreaName":"Arithmetic","AreaID":1588684116051,"TopicName":"Profit & Loss","TopicID":1589194253130,"SubTopicName":"Concepts in Profit & Loss","SubTopicID":1589194253184,"ItemOptions":null,"StarRating":null,"ItemBankName":null,"Direction":null,"IsApproved":null,"Items":"<span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"><\/span>\tA fruit seller bought 100 boxes of mangoes.
