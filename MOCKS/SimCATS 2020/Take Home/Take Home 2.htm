Choose the best answer for each question.<\/b>\r<br> \r<br>There are competing views of what it means to live in an \u201copen society\u201d. At the core is the question of how to balance the rights of different people. How do you make sure that one group\u2019s liberties do not infringe on another\u2019s? Do quotas and affirmative action rebalance an unfair system or are they just another form of discrimination? Does allowing a transgender person to use a bathroom that aligns with their identity sideline the rights of others? Has #MeToo given too much weight to victim's voices over due process for the accused? The answers to such questions have been many, varied and extremely divisive.\r<br>\r<br>The debate can be broadly divided into two camps. On one side are those who believe that inequalities have been built into systems by a particular group. Sexual harassment has existed for years, but before the #MeToo movement accusations were rare, partly because abusers were in positions of power and could suppress victim's voices. Same-sex marriage is revolutionary only because heterosexuals have defined marriage for centuries. There are few people of colour in academia in the West partly because entry tends to require social capital that favours white people. Advocates argue that legal protections are not enough when deeply ingrained cultural discrimination persists. \r<br>\r<br>On the other side of the argument are those who believe that identity politics (that is, political interests based on belonging to a particular race, sex or religion rather than an ideology) and political correctness have run amok. They argue that they are being discriminated against in a process of \u201creverse racism\/sexism\u201d or tokenism. Quotas force companies and universities to look at identities over qualifications. The #MeToo movement has become a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d that takes all accusations at face value and fails to give the accused a chance to defend themselves. Orwellian \u201cthought police\u201d are censoring political and social views, language, even Halloween costumes.

Attempts to force societies to become more open have been controversial or even counter-productive. But as the openness and tolerance of societies is under threat around the world, it is also the right time to question the excesses of some social movements. A disproportionate focus on identity and groups can obfuscate other issues, such as individual freedom. \r<br>\r<br>How to balance these concerns with the goal of creating a tolerant society is a pressing question of our time.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">This<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\"> is a question of medium difficulty.<\/span>\r<br \/>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">The passage has to be comprehended in its entirety to answer this question. The passage begins by spelling out what it means to live in an \u201copen society\u201d\u2013 open societies need to find a balance between safeguarding individual rights without infringing upon an opposing right or point of view. As an example, the author cites the conflict between affirmative action (<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">or<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\"> reservation) and the rights of those with merit. The author calls such conflicts, between diverse opinions or rights \u2013 of political interests, of race, of sex, of religion, or of an ideology\u2013 as \u201cculture wars.\u201d  While an undue focus on identity can undermine and confuse real issues like individual freedom, any attempt to force societies towards being more open is also counter-productive.  He concludes the essay by wondering about how one can \u201cbalance these concerns with the goal of creating a tolerant society (which) is a pressing question of our time.\u201d&nbsp;<\/span>\r<br \/>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 4 most closely captures this purpose of the essay.&nbsp;<\/span>\r<br \/>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 1 is incorrect. The author does not argue for or against any particular camp of the debate. In paragraph 5 and 6, the author states that, \u201cattempts to force societies to become more open have been controversial or even counter-productive\u2026 How to balance these concerns with the goal of creating a tolerant society is a pressing question of our time.\u201d The purpose of the passage is to call for a balanced debate on what it means to live in an \u201copen society\u201d. Placing disproportionate focus on any one side of the debate&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">may  lead<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\"> to counter-productive results. Thus option 1 is not the primary purpose of the passage; it is only mentioned as a warning against taking fanatical stands on the issue. Eliminate option 1.<\/span>\r<br \/>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 2 is incorrect. The author calls for a balanced discussion and not for a truce or settlement between the two sides of the debate. Eliminate option 2.<\/span>\r<br \/>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 3 is incorrect. It is similar to option 2. The author does not call for a solution to the extremely divisive \u201cculture wars\u201d. The purpose of the passage is to call for a healthy and balanced debate on the issue.<\/span>\r<br \/>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Hence the correct answer is option 4.&nbsp;<\/span>","VideoExplanation":"https:\/\/d2t84gkuc8yg6i.cloudfront.net\/ims\/SimCAT-14-2018-VA-RC-Q.1\/output.mdpmaster.m3u8","DocxSolutionUrl":null,"SolutionUploadedType":null,"PlayerMode":"VIMEO","VimeoLink":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/366431341","VimeoURI":"\/videos\/366431341","YoutubeURL":null,"ItemBankID":0,"Difficulty":"Medium","DifficultyLevel":7,"ItemBank":0,"QuestionPaper":0,"IsProofRead":null,"CorrectIndex":0,"QuestionPaperSectionID":8837,"IsRequiredQuestion":null,"TestID":0,"IsQuestionPackTimer":null,"SelectedOption":null,"IsCorrected":null,"EnteredResponse":null,"IsMarked":null,"OriginalTestID":null,"TimePerQuestion":0,"IsAttempt":null,"timetaken":null,"StudentMCAResponse":null,"ItemOptionResponse":[{"ItemOptionID":673384,"ItemID":159046,"Options":"to argue against the forceful imposition of liberal views on societies, since it may backfire.","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":673385,"ItemID":159046,"Options":"to call for a truce between the two camps, on the debate about what it means to live in an \u201copen society\u201d.","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":673386,"ItemID":159046,"Options":"to look for a solution to the extremely divisive \u201cculture wars\u201d.","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":673387,"ItemID":159046,"Options":"to highlight the need to balance diversity and individual freedom, towards creating a tolerant and open society.","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":true,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0}],"qindex":0,"qsectionindex":0,"qindexbysection":0},{"IsPassageQuestionSplit":true,"MaxWords":0,"ItemID":159047,"ItemType":"MCQ","SubjectName":"Verbal Ability","SubjectID":203,"AreaName":"Reading Comprehension","AreaID":501,"TopicName":"Application Question","TopicID":5053,"ItemOptions":null,"SubTopicID":0,"StarRating":null,"ItemBankName":null,"Direction":"","Title":"Q.2","IsApproved":null,"Items":"<p>Those \u201cwho believe that inequalities have been built into systems\u201d would agree with all of the following EXCEPT:<\/p>","ItemPassageID":17653,"PassageItemIndex":0,"Passage":"<b>The passage below is accompanied by a set of 6 questions.

Consequently, they also believe that mere legal protections are not enough to ensure equality. Since this is an \u201cEXCEPT\u201d question, we have to select that option which this group will disagree with.<\/span> <br \/> <br \/>Option 1 is incorrect. They would be in favour of the idea that backward classes have been discriminated against and, therefore, would definitely argue for quotas in order for them to move forward in life. Thus, option 1 is not an exception and can be eliminated. <br \/> <br \/><span>Option 3 is incorrect. It is clearly mentioned in the second paragraph that \u201csexual harassment has existed for years, but before the #MeToo movement accusations were rare, partly because abusers were in positions of power and could suppress victim's voices.\u201d Thus, we can conclude that they would agree with the demand that the accused in the #MeToo movement must be punished. They would find this to be a necessary, though not sufficient, step towards providing legal protection to those who have suffered for long due to \u2018inequalities that have been built into the system\u2019. Eliminate option 3.<\/span> <br \/> <br \/><span>Option 4 is incorrect. If all the citizens and permanent residents of country X must have access to free public healthcare, then there is no bias or inequality ingrained in the system. Thus, they are likely to agree with this situation. Eliminate option 4.<\/span> <br \/> <br \/><span>Option 2 is correct. If a baker refuses to bake a cake for gay couples based on the belief that gay marriage is sacrilegious, it is a bias ingrained against people who do not align with the baker\u2019s views. Therefore, the advocates of systemic inequality will perceive this as an instance of favoring the idea that has been perpetuated by systems characterized by inherent inequalities. Consequently, they will NOT agree with it.

He had a hefty grammar book in his backpack, but he didn\u2019t plan to open it unless he had to. Our plan was for me to observe how he went about learning a new language.<br><br>Berscia is a twenty-seven-year-old Peruvian, who looked like any other laid-back young tourist, except for the intense focus with which he takes in a new environment. Linguistic competence was the subject of my own interest in Berscia. He is a hyperpolyglot, with a command of twenty-two living languages, thirteen of which he speaks fluently. He also knows six classical or endangered languages. Superlative feats have always thrilled average mortals, in part, perhaps, because they register as a victory for Team Homo Sapiens: they redefine the humanly possible. If Berscia can speak twenty-two languages, perhaps you can crank up your high-school Spanish or learn enough of your grandma\u2019s Korean to understand her stories. <br><br>The word \u201chyperpolyglot\u201d was coined two decades ago, by a British linguist, Richard Hudson. But the phenomenon and its mystique are ancient. In Acts 2 of the New Testament, Christ\u2019s disciples receive the Holy Spirit and can suddenly \u201cspeak in tongues\u201d, preaching in the languages of \u201cevery nation under heaven.\u201d Elizabeth I allegedly mastered all the tongues of her realm. With a mere ten languages, Shakespeare\u2019s Queen does not qualify as a hyperpolyglot; the accepted threshold is eleven. The prowess of Giuseppe Mezzofantiis more astounding and better documented. Mezzofanti, an Italian cardinal, was fluent in at least thirty languages and studied another forty-two. In the decades that he lived in Rome, as the chief custodian of the Vatican Library, notables from around the world dropped by to interrogate him in their mother tongues, and he flitted as nimbly among them as a bee in a rose garden. <br><br>No one becomes a hyperpolyglot by osmosis, or without sacrifice\u2014it\u2019s a rare, herculean feat. Berscia, who gave up a promising tennis career that interfered with his language studies, reckons that there are \u201cabout twenty of us in Europe, and we all know, or know of, one another.\u201d He put me in touch with a few of his peers, including Corentin Bourdeau, a young French linguist who knows eleven languages; and Emanuele Marini, a shy Italian in his forties, who speaks a total of nearly thirty languages. Neither willingly uses English, resenting its status as a global bully language. Ellen Jovin, a dynamic New Yorker explained that her own avid study of languages\u2014twenty-five, to date\u2014\u201cis almost an apology for the dominance of English. Polyglottery is an antithesis to linguistic chauvinism.\u201d<br><br>Berscia and I took a budget flight from Brussels to Malta, arriving at midnight. Our taxi-driver presumed we were mother and son. \u201cHow do you say \u2018mother\u2019 in Maltese?\u201d Berscia asked him, in English. By the time we had reached the hotel, he knew the whole Maltese family. Two local newlyweds, still in their wedding clothes, were just checking in. \u201cHow do you say \u2018congratulations\u2019?\u201d Berscia asked. The answer wasnifrah. Nearly all Maltese spoke good English, though Berscia valued their mistakes. \u201cWhen someone says, \u2018He is angry for me,\u2019 you learn something about his language\u2014it represents a convention in Maltese. The richness of a language\u2019s conventions is the highest barrier to sounding like a native in it.\u201d<br><br>He spent several days raptly eavesdropping on native speakers. If we took a taxi to some church or ruin, he would ride shotgun and ask the driver to teach him a few common Maltese phrases, or to tell him a joke. He didn\u2019t record these conversations, but in the encounter he would use them to start a conversation. Hyperpolyglots are said to exhibit an imperative \u201cwill to plasticity, \u201cwhich means plasticity of the brain. But, here, I was seeing plasticity of a different sort. You have to inhabit a language, not only speak it, and fluency requires some dramatic flair.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">This<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\"> is an easy question.<\/span>\r<br \/>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 1 is incorrect.

The option contradicts the claims made in the passage. Refer to paragraph 4: \u201cNo one becomes a hyperpolyglot by osmosis, or without sacrifice\u2014it\u2019s a rare, herculean feat. Berscia, who gave up a promising tennis career that interfered with his language studies...\u201dThus, becoming a polyglot is not an easy task. Eliminate option 1.<\/span>\r<br \/>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 2 is incorrect; it is contrary to the author\u2019s view. In the last paragraph, the author mentions a popular belief, which is that \u201chyperpolyglots are said to exhibit an imperative \u201cwill to plasticity,\u201d which means plasticity of the brain.\u201d But he doesn\u2019t quite agree to this idea. His view is that \u201cyou have to inhabit a language, not only speak it, and fluency requires some dramatic flair.\u201d This is the author\u2019s response to the very active and lively manner in which Berscia went on to learning Maltese\u2014mostly by initiating random conversations with the native speakers. Therefore, what the author claims is that the process of learning a new language involves more than just \u2018plasticity of the brain\u2019. Eliminate option 2.<\/span>\r<br \/>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 3 is incorrect. Refer to paragraph 5: \u201cNearly all Maltese spoke good English, though Berscia valued their mistakes. When someone says, \u2018He is angry for me,\u2019 you learn something about his language\u2014it represents a convention in Maltese.\u201d Here, the author refers to the mistakes that the native speakers of Maltese make while speaking to Berscia in English. According to Berscia, these mistakes give clues about the \u2018conventions\u2019 or peculiarities (which makes it different from English) of&nbsp;<\/span>that language, thus assisting in learning that language. Therefore, Berscia learns Maltese through the mistakes that they made in English. Hence, eliminate option 3.\r<br \/>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 4 is correct. Refer to paragraph 4: \u201cHe put me in touch with a few of his peers, including Corentin Bourdeau, a young French linguist who knows eleven languages; and Emanuele Marini... who speaks a total of nearly thirty languages. Neither willingly uses English, resenting its status as a global bully language.

Polyglottery is an antithesis to linguistic chauvinism.\u201d\u201d There exists a general resentment among the community of hyperpolyglots, at the linguistic chauvinism exercised by English language. While Ellen likes to think that her learning of new languages is an apology to them for the global dominance exerted by English, Marini and Bourdeau deliberately don\u2019t use English for the same reason.&nbsp;<\/span>\r<br \/>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Hence the correct answer is option 4.<\/span>","VideoExplanation":"https:\/\/d2t84gkuc8yg6i.cloudfront.net\/ims\/SimCAT-14-2018-VA-RC-Q.8\/output.mdpmaster.m3u8","DocxSolutionUrl":null,"SolutionUploadedType":null,"PlayerMode":"VIMEO","VimeoLink":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/366429967","VimeoURI":"\/videos\/366429967","YoutubeURL":null,"ItemBankID":0,"Difficulty":"Difficult","DifficultyLevel":12,"ItemBank":0,"QuestionPaper":0,"IsProofRead":null,"CorrectIndex":0,"QuestionPaperSectionID":8837,"IsRequiredQuestion":null,"TestID":0,"IsQuestionPackTimer":null,"SelectedOption":null,"IsCorrected":null,"EnteredResponse":null,"IsMarked":null,"OriginalTestID":null,"TimePerQuestion":0,"IsAttempt":null,"timetaken":null,"StudentMCAResponse":null,"ItemOptionResponse":[{"ItemOptionID":673412,"ItemID":159053,"Options":"Those like Rojas- Berscia validate the ease with which one can become a polyglot.","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":673413,"ItemID":159053,"Options":"The process of learning a new language mostly depends on \u2018plasticity of the brain\u2019.","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":673414,"ItemID":159053,"Options":"A language is learnt best through the mistakes that one makes while speaking that language.","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":673415,"ItemID":159053,"Options":"There are a few hyperpolyglots who believe polyglottery can reduce linguistic chauvinism.","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":true,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0}],"qindex":7,"qsectionindex":0,"qindexbysection":7},{"IsPassageQuestionSplit":true,"MaxWords":0,"ItemID":159054,"ItemType":"MCQ","SubjectName":"Verbal Ability","SubjectID":203,"AreaName":"Reading Comprehension","AreaID":501,"TopicName":"Specific Detail","TopicID":4984,"ItemOptions":null,"SubTopicID":0,"StarRating":null,"ItemBankName":null,"Direction":"","Title":"Q.9","IsApproved":null,"Items":"According to the passage, all of the following are true about learning a new language, EXCEPT:","ItemPassageID":17654,"PassageItemIndex":0,"Passage":"<b>The passage below is accompanied by a set of 6 questions.

Paragraph 4 states that \u201chis notion of happiness was \u2018to fight\u2019; his concept of misery was \u2018to submit\u2019.\u201d Thus, option 3 is not an exception and can be eliminated.<\/span>\r<br \/>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 4 is correct.

Marx was wrong about capitalism in the raw: great entrepreneurs do amass fortunes by dreaming up new products or new ways of organising production. But he had a point about capitalism in its bureaucratic form. A depressing number of today\u2019s bosses are corporate bureaucrats rather than wealth-creators, who use convenient formulae to make sure their salaries go ever upwards. They work hand in glove with a growing crowd of other rent-seekers, such as management consultants, professional board members and retired politicians.<br><br>The backlash against capitalism is mounting in the form of populist anger. So far liberal reformers are proving sadly inferior to their predecessors in terms of both their grasp of the crisis and their ability to generate solutions. They should reacquaint themselves with the great man\u2014not only to understand the serious faults that he brilliantly identified in the system, but to remind themselves of the disaster that awaits if they fail to confront them.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">This<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\"> is a question of medium difficulty.<\/span>\r<br \/>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 1 is incorrect.
