Choose the best answer for each question.<\/b><br><br>Diplomats the world over know that a well-chosen turn of phrase can make or break a negotiation. But the psychological effects of different grammatical structures have not been investigated as thoroughly as they might have been. A study just published in Psychological Science, by Michal Reifen-Tagar and Orly Idan, two researchers at the Interdisciplinary Centre Herzliya, in Israel, has thrown some light on the matter. Dr Reifen-Tagar and Dr Idan have confirmed that a good way to use language to reduce tension is to rely, whenever possible, on nouns rather than verbs.<br><br>Dr Idan, a psycholinguist, knew from previous work that the use of an adjective instead of a noun in a sentence (\u201cJewish\u201d rather than \u201cJew\u201d, for example) can shape both judgment and behaviour. Likewise, Dr Reifen-Tagar, a social psychologist, knew from her own earlier research that successful diplomacy often hinges on managing anger in negotiating parties. Putting their heads together, they suspected that employing nouns (\u201cI am in favour of the removal of settlers\u201d), rather than verbs (\u201cI am in favour of removing settlers\u201d), to convey support for policy positions would have a calming effect. The one is more like a statement of an abstract belief. The other is more like a prescription of a course of action and is thus, they hypothesised, more likely to arouse emotions.<br><br>To test this idea they recruited 129 Jewish-Israeli college students and presented them with statements about policies associated with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Specifically, these statements concerned Israeli concessions on matters like the release of Palestinian prisoners, the borders of Israel, the return to Israel of Palestinian refugees and the division of Jerusalem.<br><br>Half of the statements were given in noun form (\u201cI support the division of Jerusalem\u201d). The other half were given in verb form (\u201cI support dividing Jerusalem\u201d). Participants responded to each on a six-point scale, where a value of one indicated \u201cI totally disagree\u201d and a value of six indicated \u201cI totally agree.\u201d All of the statements were in Hebrew, in which such sentence structures are natural and acceptable. After each statement was given, participants were asked to indicate, also on a six-point scale, the extent to which they would feel anger towards the state of Israel if the concession in question were actually granted.<br><br>As the researchers had hypothesised, presenting the statements in noun form reduced feelings of anger. Participants so treated had an average anger score of 3.21, in contrast to the 3.67 averaged by those presented with verb-form statements. This is a statistically significant difference. The noun forms of the statements also increased support for the concessions.<br><br>Given these results, Dr Reifen-Tagar and Dr Idan wondered whether the reduced anger induced by the noun form would translate into reduced support for hostile action toward Palestinians. They therefore ran the experiment again, having recruited 270 new participants, and with additional statements like \u201cI am in favour of demolishing\/the demolition of homes belonging to family members of those involved in terrorist activities\u201d and \u201cof cutting off\/the cutting off of supply of electricity to Gaza during wartime\u201d.<br><br>The results were much the same as those in the earlier experiment.

But the psychological effects of different grammatical structures have not been investigated as thoroughly as they might have been.\u201d Hence, diplomats are mentioned in order to introduce the idea of how grammatical structures can invoke specific psychological effects. The emotional responses to such \u2018well-chosen turns of phrases\u2019 are then elaborated in the passage.&nbsp;<\/span>\r<br \/>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 1 is incorrect. The specific intention of mentioning the diplomats is not to stress that what they know should be examined further, but as the evidence for something that is not popularly understood in spite of its importance.  Reject option 1.<\/span>\r<br \/>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 3 is incorrect. Though diplomats may be examples of skilled negotiators, as the option suggests, the example is not cited to prove that they understand the importance of the nuances in speech. The passage is about language, and not skilled negotiators or their understanding of the language. Reject option 3.<\/span>\r<br \/>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 4 is incorrect. \u2018Conventions of diplomacy\u2019 stated in option 4 is too general.

Reject option 4.<\/span>\r<br \/>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 2 is correct. The author mentions diplomats in order to introduce and to impart credibility to his thesis \u2013 that different grammatical structures used to express the same idea can invoke different emotional responses.

A study just published in Psychological Science, by Michal Reifen-Tagar and Orly Idan, two researchers at the Interdisciplinary Centre Herzliya, in Israel, has thrown some light on the matter. Dr Reifen-Tagar and Dr Idan have confirmed that a good way to use language to reduce tension is to rely, whenever possible, on nouns rather than verbs.<br><br>Dr Idan, a psycholinguist, knew from previous work that the use of an adjective instead of a noun in a sentence (\u201cJewish\u201d rather than \u201cJew\u201d, for example) can shape both judgment and behaviour. Likewise, Dr Reifen-Tagar, a social psychologist, knew from her own earlier research that successful diplomacy often hinges on managing anger in negotiating parties. Putting their heads together, they suspected that employing nouns (\u201cI am in favour of the removal of settlers\u201d), rather than verbs (\u201cI am in favour of removing settlers\u201d), to convey support for policy positions would have a calming effect. The one is more like a statement of an abstract belief. The other is more like a prescription of a course of action and is thus, they hypothesised, more likely to arouse emotions.<br><br>To test this idea they recruited 129 Jewish-Israeli college students and presented them with statements about policies associated with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

After each statement was given, participants were asked to indicate, also on a six-point scale, the extent to which they would feel anger towards the state of Israel if the concession in question were actually granted.<br><br>As the researchers had hypothesised, presenting the statements in noun form reduced feelings of anger.

The noun forms of the statements also increased support for the concessions.<br><br>Given these results, Dr Reifen-Tagar and Dr Idan wondered whether the reduced anger induced by the noun form would translate into reduced support for hostile action toward Palestinians. They therefore ran the experiment again, having recruited 270 new participants, and with additional statements like \u201cI am in favour of demolishing\/the demolition of homes belonging to family members of those involved in terrorist activities\u201d and \u201cof cutting off\/the cutting off of supply of electricity to Gaza during wartime\u201d.<br><br>The results were much the same as those in the earlier experiment.
