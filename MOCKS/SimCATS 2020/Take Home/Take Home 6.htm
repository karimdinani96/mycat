The first paragraph states that \u201c\u2026 countries such as Albania and Algeria have a greater percentage of women amongst their STEM graduates than countries lauded for their high levels of gender equality, such as Finland, Norway and Sweden.\u201d  Option 1 states nothing more than this; hence does not capture the central idea.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Counter-intuitive means \u201ccontrary to intuition or to common-sense expectation.\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> Reject option 1.<\/span>\r<br \/>\t<br \/>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Option 2 is correct. The passage looks at the results of a study on gender disparity and concludes by stating that the paradox can be further analysed for practical use in interventions. Thus the central idea of the passage is to use the results of the study on gender disparity to design effective interventions and increase female participation in STEM. Retain option 2.<\/span>\r<br \/>\t<br \/>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Option 3 is incorrect. The passage ends with the suggestion that the results of the study can be put to good use. However the central idea of the passage cannot be said to be the design of effective interventions based on the study. Option 3 is also highly misleading in its reference to gender disparity in general \u2013 the passage is limited the sex ratio in STEM. Reject option 3.<\/span>\r<br \/>\t<br \/>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Option 4 is incorrect. The passage does not comment on the study being illogical. The option also says, \u2018the study must be used to bring gender parity in STEM.\u2019 The passage is about improving female participation in STEM through intervention \u2013 not about bringing gender parity.

The study observes that gender equality does not lead to greater female participation in STEM. The first sentence the passage points out that \u201cCountries with greater gender equality see a smaller proportion of women taking degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), a new study has found.\u201d Reject option 1.<\/span>\r<br \/>\t<br \/>\t\tOption 2 is incorrect. In paragraph 5, the passage asserts that \u201c<span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">The results show that there is a disparity in all countries, but with the gap once again larger in more gender-equal countries.\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> This implies that in countries with greater gender&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">equality<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">,females<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> participated at lower proportions in STEM than in countries with lower gender equality. Reject option 2.<\/span>\r<br \/>\t<br \/>\t\tOption 3 is correct. One can conclude from the passage that students in gender-equal countries are less likely to feel economic pressure and therefore, less likely to choose careers in STEM which are better paying. Professor&nbsp;<span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Stoet<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> says that \u201cSTEM careers are generally secure and well-paid but the risks of not following such a path can vary.\u201d One can conclude therefore that&nbsp;<\/span>students in gender-equal countries have a much higher social security and the risk of not taking a well-paid career path in STEM is much lower for them. So option 3 which states that they are more risk-averse does not apply to them. It is girls in low gender-equal countries that avoid risk by taking up higher paying STEM careers. Retain option 3.\r<br \/>\t<br \/>\t\tOption 4 is incorrect. Comparing the gender disparity in gender-equal and low gender-equal countries, the passage does conclude that girls in low gender-equal countries are more likely than their counterparts in gender-equal countries, to choose STEM.

Refer the last paragraph. \u201cIf governments want to increase women\u2019s participation in STEM, a more effective strategy might be to target the girls who are clearly being lost from the STEM pathway \u2013 those for whom science and maths are their best subjects and who enjoy it but still don\u2019t choose it.\u201d Hence, preventing dropouts through interventions with the target group is likely to improve the sex ratio in STEM.&nbsp;\r<br \/>\t<br \/>\t\tThus the correct answer is option 4.<span style=\"font-family: ;\">&nbsp;<\/span>\r<br \/>","VideoExplanation":"https:\/\/d2t84gkuc8yg6i.cloudfront.net\/ims\/SimCAT-10-2018-VA-RC-Q.6\/output.mdpmaster.m3u8","DocxSolutionUrl":null,"SolutionUploadedType":null,"PlayerMode":"VIMEO","VimeoLink":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/366426864","VimeoURI":"\/videos\/366426864","YoutubeURL":null,"ItemBankID":0,"Difficulty":"Easy","DifficultyLevel":4,"ItemBank":0,"QuestionPaper":0,"IsProofRead":null,"CorrectIndex":0,"QuestionPaperSectionID":8572,"IsRequiredQuestion":null,"TestID":0,"IsQuestionPackTimer":null,"SelectedOption":null,"IsCorrected":null,"EnteredResponse":null,"IsMarked":null,"OriginalTestID":null,"TimePerQuestion":0,"IsAttempt":null,"timetaken":null,"StudentMCAResponse":null,"ItemOptionResponse":[{"ItemOptionID":664698,"ItemID":156867,"Options":"Campaign to target girls to encourage them to study STEM.<\/span>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":664699,"ItemID":156867,"Options":"Bring in legislation to improve gender parity in society.<\/span>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":664700,"ItemID":156867,"Options":"Initiate reforms for the economic development.<\/span>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":664701,"ItemID":156867,"Options":"Design incentives to prevent drop outs from STEM.<\/span>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":true,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0}],"qindex":5,"qsectionindex":0,"qindexbysection":5},{"IsPassageQuestionSplit":true,"MaxWords":0,"ItemID":156868,"ItemType":"MCQ","SubjectName":"Verbal Ability","SubjectID":203,"AreaName":"Reading Comprehension","AreaID":501,"TopicName":"Primary Purpose","TopicID":5054,"ItemOptions":null,"SubTopicID":0,"StarRating":null,"ItemBankName":null,"Direction":"","Title":"Q.7","IsApproved":null,"Items":"<span style=\"font-family: ;color: #121212;\">The primary purpose of the passage is to:<\/span>","ItemPassageID":17434,"PassageItemIndex":0,"Passage":"<p><strong>The passage below is accompanied by a set of 6 questions.

Choose the best answer for each <\/strong><\/span> <strong>question.<\/strong><\/p><p><br \/>Equating money with value is in many cases a necessary expedient. People make transactions with money, of one form or another, rather than with \u201cutility\u201d or happiness. But even if economists often have no choice but to judge outcomes in terms of who ends up with how many dollars, they can pay more attention to the way focusing on \u201cmaterial well-being\u201d, as determined by the \u201cmeasuring rod of money\u201d, influences and constrains their work.<\/p><p><br \/>The measuring rod itself often causes trouble. Not every dollar is of equal value, for instance. You might think that if two economists were forced to bid on an apple, the winner would desire the apple more and the auction would thereby have found the best, welfare-maximising use for the apple. But the evidence suggests that money has diminishing marginal value: the more you have, the less you value an extra dollar. The winner might therefore end up with the apple not because it will bring him more joy, but because his greater wealth means that his bid is less of a sacrifice. Economists are aware of this problem. It features, for example, in debates about the link between income and happiness across countries.

But the evidence suggests that money has diminishing marginal value: the more you have, the less you value an extra dollar. The winner might therefore end up with the apple not because it will bring him more joy, but because his greater wealth means that his bid is less of a sacrifice.

Despite efforts to improve such statistics, these problems remain. A dollar spent on financial services or a pricey medical test counts towards GDP whether or not it contributes to human welfare.

Choose the best answer for each question. <\/strong><\/span><\/p><p><br \/>The concept of multitudinous self is based on the psychologist UlricNeisser\u2019s account of the self, laid out in his paper \u2018Five Kinds of Self-knowledge\u2019. Neisser encourages us to reevaluate the sources of information that help us to identify the self. There are five sources, which are so different from one another that it is plausible to conceive each as establishing a different \u2018self\u2019. First there is the ecological self, or the embodied self in the physical world, which perceives and interacts with the physical environment; the interpersonal self, or the self-embedded in the social world, which constitutes and is constituted by inter-subjective relationships with others; the temporally extended self, or the self in time, which is grounded in memories of the past and anticipation of the future; the private self which is exposed to experiences available only to the first person and not to others; and finally the conceptual self, which (accurately or falsely) represents the self to the self by drawing on the properties or characteristics of not only the person but also the social and cultural context to which she belongs.<\/p><p><br \/>The multitudinous self is a variation of the Neisserian self in that it individuates the self as a complex mechanism with many dimensions that interact and work together to maintain a more or less stable agency over time. At times these different dimensions of the \u2018self\u2019 contradict each other. Interpersonally, I might come across as gregarious, and present an image of someone who enjoys companionship, yet my private sense of self might be that I am shy and introverted. Because these five dimensions are all more or less integrated, however, they help with self-regulation, and function as a locus of experience and agency. The multitudinous self gives a partial but helpful representation of the selves we encounter in our daily lives. It is also scientifically scrutable.<\/p><p><br \/>To see how this is so, take the following example. We can acquire information about the selfhood of 12-year-olds, tracking information about them in all five dimensions by relying on both first-person and third-person perspectives. First, we could interview them on how the physical changes in their bodies are manifested in their ecological dimension: how the changes in their height or weight affect their physical activity, or how such physical changes affect their interpersonal dimension through their effects on the nature and quality of their interpersonal relationships.<\/p><p><br \/>Similarly, we can acquire information on how the physiological changes are manifested in the temporal, private and conceptual aspects of themselves. For instance, through first-person reports, we can evaluate what kind of short-term memory loss a preteen might be experiencing, and whether it affects his sense of the future. This would yield information about the temporal dimension of the preteen self. Or we might learn about the private aspect of the self by interviewing them about \u2018what it is like\u2019 to be 12. Finally, to develop a robust understanding of how their self-concepts are evolving in response to the changes they are undergoing, we might ask them how they represent themselves to themselves. A girl\u2019s (or boy\u2019s) weight might be considered in a typical range for her height, sex and age, but not seem so to herself.<\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":false,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<p><span>This<\/span><span> is a difficult question.<\/span> <br \/> <br \/> <span>Option 1 is incorrect.

Choose the best answer for each question. <\/strong><\/span><\/p><p><br \/>The concept of multitudinous self is based on the psychologist UlricNeisser\u2019s account of the self, laid out in his paper \u2018Five Kinds of Self-knowledge\u2019. Neisser encourages us to reevaluate the sources of information that help us to identify the self. There are five sources, which are so different from one another that it is plausible to conceive each as establishing a different \u2018self\u2019. First there is the ecological self, or the embodied self in the physical world, which perceives and interacts with the physical environment; the interpersonal self, or the self-embedded in the social world, which constitutes and is constituted by inter-subjective relationships with others; the temporally extended self, or the self in time, which is grounded in memories of the past and anticipation of the future; the private self which is exposed to experiences available only to the first person and not to others; and finally the conceptual self, which (accurately or falsely) represents the self to the self by drawing on the properties or characteristics of not only the person but also the social and cultural context to which she belongs.<\/p><p><br \/>The multitudinous self is a variation of the Neisserian self in that it individuates the self as a complex mechanism with many dimensions that interact and work together to maintain a more or less stable agency over time. At times these different dimensions of the \u2018self\u2019 contradict each other. Interpersonally, I might come across as gregarious, and present an image of someone who enjoys companionship, yet my private sense of self might be that I am shy and introverted. Because these five dimensions are all more or less integrated, however, they help with self-regulation, and function as a locus of experience and agency. The multitudinous self gives a partial but helpful representation of the selves we encounter in our daily lives. It is also scientifically scrutable.<\/p><p><br \/>To see how this is so, take the following example. We can acquire information about the selfhood of 12-year-olds, tracking information about them in all five dimensions by relying on both first-person and third-person perspectives. First, we could interview them on how the physical changes in their bodies are manifested in their ecological dimension: how the changes in their height or weight affect their physical activity, or how such physical changes affect their interpersonal dimension through their effects on the nature and quality of their interpersonal relationships.<\/p><p><br \/>Similarly, we can acquire information on how the physiological changes are manifested in the temporal, private and conceptual aspects of themselves. For instance, through first-person reports, we can evaluate what kind of short-term memory loss a preteen might be experiencing, and whether it affects his sense of the future. This would yield information about the temporal dimension of the preteen self. Or we might learn about the private aspect of the self by interviewing them about \u2018what it is like\u2019 to be 12. Finally, to develop a robust understanding of how their self-concepts are evolving in response to the changes they are undergoing, we might ask them how they represent themselves to themselves. A girl\u2019s (or boy\u2019s) weight might be considered in a typical range for her height, sex and age, but not seem so to herself.<\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":false,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">This<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\"> is a difficult question.&nbsp;<\/span>\r<br \/>\t<br \/>\t\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 1 is correct. Paragraph 2 states that the multitudinous self is a variation of the&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Neisserian<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\"> self in that it is an integration of the 5&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Neisserian<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\"> sources of information. The example of the girl shows how scientific scrutiny of the multitudinous self occurs \u2013 Paragraph 3 states<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">,  \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">We can acquire information about the selfhood of 12-year-olds, tracking information about them in all five dimensions by relying on both first-person and third-person perspectives\u201d. \u201cSimilarly, we can acquire information on how the physiological changes are manifested in the temporal, private and conceptual aspects of themselves.\u201d  Thus the five dimensional&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Neisserian<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\"> self is used as a base for getting information from the multitudinous self \u2013 the integrated self. In the case of the example the girl whose self-image is incorrect, the multitudinous self has received incorrect information from the&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Neisserian<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\"> self. Retain option 1.<\/span>\r<br \/>\t<br \/>\t\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 2 is incorrect. The multitudinous self is the merging of the five dimensions of the self from&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Neisserian<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\"> psychology. It is incorrect therefore to speak of the merging of the multitudinous and the&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Neisserian<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\"> self as option 2 does. Reject option 2.<\/span>\r<br \/>\t<br \/>\t\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 3 is incorrect. The question is not one of stability as this option suggests. The multitudinous self is not unstable because of wrong information from the&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Niesserian<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\"> self but has simply received this incorrect information from it. Reject option 3.<\/span>\r<br \/>\t<br \/>\t\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 4 is incorrect. Self-regulation as used in the second paragraph refers to the integration of the five dimensions of the self. Also viewing information incorrectly does not mean that the self fails to act as a locus of experience and agency. In the example of the girl in fact, it does act as a locus of experience and agency \u2013 or a point of control of experience and agency.

Thus, we can account for the behaviour of propositions like \u201cJohn is bald\u201d where John is a borderline case of baldness.
