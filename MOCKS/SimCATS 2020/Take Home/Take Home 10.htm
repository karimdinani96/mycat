Choose the best answer to each question.<\/strong><\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">The contemporary theory of what is standardly referred to as economic rationality is descended from Adam Smith\u2019s egoistic model of economic behaviour; it is based on a much more sophisticated and quantitatively precise but still-idealized model of the psychology of individual choice. The modern discipline of decision theory has permitted a great increase in the exactness of what we can say about this type of human motivation, by introducing quantitative measures of subjective degrees of belief and subjective degrees of preference.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">If, for example, on a cloudy day you have to decide whether or not to take an umbrella when you go out, you face four possibilities: (1) rain and umbrella; (2) no rain and umbrella; (3) rain and no umbrella; (4) no rain and no umbrella. Obviously, your decision will depend both on your estimate of the likelihood of rain and on how much you mind getting wet, or alternatively how much you mind carrying an umbrella when it isn\u2019t raining, but decision theory makes this more precise. It says your choice is explained by the fact that you assign a probability\u00a0<\/span><em><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">p<\/span><\/em><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">\u00a0between zero and one to the prospect of rain, and (ignoring misty in-between states) a probability of <em>one minus\u00a0<\/em><\/span><em><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">p<\/span><\/em><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">\u00a0to the prospect of no rain, and that you assign a desirability, positive or negative, to each of the possibilities (1) to (4). By multiplying the probability and the desirability for each of these outcomes, one can calculate what is called the \u201cexpected value\u201d of each of them, and therefore the expected value of taking an umbrella and of not taking an umbrella. The rational choice is to do what has the higher expected value.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">Decision theory applies this kind of calculus to choices among alternatives of any complexity, with any possible assignment of subjective probabilities and <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">desirabilities<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">. With the help of game theory, it can be extended to multi-person interactions, as in a market economy. Decision theory assigns these supposed quantifiable psychological states to individuals only on the basis of an idealization. They are not discovered by asking people to report their subjective probabilities and <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">desirabilities<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">: in general, people do not have introspective access to these numbers. Rather, precise psychological states of this type are assigned by the theory itself, on the basis of something to which people do have access, namely their preferences or rankings (better, worse, indifferent) among alternatives.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">This by itself does not imply that the states are fictional: real but unobservable underlying causes can often be inferred from observable effects. The fiction comes from the way the inference proceeds in this case. Given a sufficiently extensive set of preferences (rankings of alternatives) by an individual, it is possible, employing relatively simple laws, to assign to that individual a set of subjective probabilities and <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">desirabilities<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\"> that would account for those preferences,<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">if the individual were rational in the sense of the theory<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">. But since rationality in the sense of the theory involves such superhuman capacities as immunity to logical error, instantaneous calculation of logical consequences, and assigning equal probability and desirability to all possibilities that are logically equivalent, it is clear that no actual humans are rational in this sense. <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">So<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\"> if we use the theory of economic rationality to think about the behaviour of real human beings, we are treating them<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">as if<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">\u00a0they were super-rational; we are employing a useful fiction, which allows us to bring human action under quantitative laws.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">The fiction is useful only for certain purposes. If it is not to lead us astray, we have to recognise the ways in which it deviates from reality, and to correct for those deviations when they make a difference that matters. This is, in fact, the concern of the recently developed field <\/span><span style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">of behavioural economics, which tries to identify the consequences of systematic deviations of actual human behaviour from the standards of classical economic rationality. For example, people often fail to count logically equivalent possibilities as equally desirable: an outcome described in terms of the probability of death will be evaluated differently from the same outcome described in terms of the probability of survival.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: medium;\">If we try to formulate laws of human psychology, we will inevitably have to ignore a great deal of the messy complexity of actual human life. This is sometimes legitimate, provided that we recognize the idealization and are prepared to restore the complexity when necessary\u2014when, for example, assuming the rationality of every free market would send us off an economic cliff.<\/span><\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":false,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> This is a difficult question:<\/span> <br \/> <br \/><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">The passage begins by telling us that, what economists routinely refer to as \u2018economic rationality\u2019 has roots in Adam smith\u2019s model of economic behavior. The passage then explains how modern decision theory achieves accuracy by ignoring subjective probabilities and desirabilities of individual choices. The author spends the better part of the passage debunking the central premise of economic rationality. He explains that human beings\u00a0are not super-rational and do not always make decisions that are rationally the best for them. In the last two paragraphs he concedes that observing deviations from economic rationality, as is done in the field of behavioral economics, can yield useful results and help us avoid economic disasters.\u00a0<\/span> <br \/> <br \/><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">Option 3 best captures this.\u00a0<\/span><br \/> <br \/><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">Option 1 correctly captures the argument of the passage that economic rationality is a flawed theory but it does not capture the idea expressed in the last paragraph.<\/span> <br \/><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">Option 2 incorrectly brings in decision theory.

Obviously, your decision will depend both on your estimate of the likelihood of rain and on how much you mind getting wet, or alternatively how much you mind carrying an umbrella when it isn\u2019t raining, but decision theory makes this more precise. It says your choice is explained by the fact that you assign a probability\u00a0<\/span><em><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">p<\/span><\/em><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">\u00a0between zero and one to the prospect of rain, and (ignoring misty in-between states) a probability of <em>one minus\u00a0<\/em><\/span><em><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">p<\/span><\/em><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">\u00a0to the prospect of no rain, and that you assign a desirability, positive or negative, to each of the possibilities (1) to (4). By multiplying the probability and the desirability for each of these outcomes, one can calculate what is called the \u201cexpected value\u201d of each of them, and therefore the expected value of taking an umbrella and of not taking an umbrella.

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/strong><\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">The contemporary theory of what is standardly referred to as economic rationality is descended from Adam Smith\u2019s egoistic model of economic behaviour; it is based on a much more sophisticated and quantitatively precise but still-idealized model of the psychology of individual choice. The modern discipline of decision theory has permitted a great increase in the exactness of what we can say about this type of human motivation, by introducing quantitative measures of subjective degrees of belief and subjective degrees of preference.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">If, for example, on a cloudy day you have to decide whether or not to take an umbrella when you go out, you face four possibilities: (1) rain and umbrella; (2) no rain and umbrella; (3) rain and no umbrella; (4) no rain and no umbrella. Obviously, your decision will depend both on your estimate of the likelihood of rain and on how much you mind getting wet, or alternatively how much you mind carrying an umbrella when it isn\u2019t raining, but decision theory makes this more precise. It says your choice is explained by the fact that you assign a probability\u00a0<\/span><em><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">p<\/span><\/em><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">\u00a0between zero and one to the prospect of rain, and (ignoring misty in-between states) a probability of <em>one minus\u00a0<\/em><\/span><em><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">p<\/span><\/em><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">\u00a0to the prospect of no rain, and that you assign a desirability, positive or negative, to each of the possibilities (1) to (4). By multiplying the probability and the desirability for each of these outcomes, one can calculate what is called the \u201cexpected value\u201d of each of them, and therefore the expected value of taking an umbrella and of not taking an umbrella. The rational choice is to do what has the higher expected value.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">Decision theory applies this kind of calculus to choices among alternatives of any complexity, with any possible assignment of subjective probabilities and <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">desirabilities<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">. With the help of game theory, it can be extended to multi-person interactions, as in a market economy. Decision theory assigns these supposed quantifiable psychological states to individuals only on the basis of an idealization. They are not discovered by asking people to report their subjective probabilities and <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">desirabilities<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">: in general, people do not have introspective access to these numbers. Rather, precise psychological states of this type are assigned by the theory itself, on the basis of something to which people do have access, namely their preferences or rankings (better, worse, indifferent) among alternatives.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">This by itself does not imply that the states are fictional: real but unobservable underlying causes can often be inferred from observable effects. The fiction comes from the way the inference proceeds in this case. Given a sufficiently extensive set of preferences (rankings of alternatives) by an individual, it is possible, employing relatively simple laws, to assign to that individual a set of subjective probabilities and <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">desirabilities<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\"> that would account for those preferences,<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">if the individual were rational in the sense of the theory<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">. But since rationality in the sense of the theory involves such superhuman capacities as immunity to logical error, instantaneous calculation of logical consequences, and assigning equal probability and desirability to all possibilities that are logically equivalent, it is clear that no actual humans are rational in this sense. <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">So<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\"> if we use the theory of economic rationality to think about the behaviour of real human beings, we are treating them<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">as if<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">\u00a0they were super-rational; we are employing a useful fiction, which allows us to bring human action under quantitative laws.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">The fiction is useful only for certain purposes. If it is not to lead us astray, we have to recognise the ways in which it deviates from reality, and to correct for those deviations when they make a difference that matters. This is, in fact, the concern of the recently developed field <\/span><span style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">of behavioural economics, which tries to identify the consequences of systematic deviations of actual human behaviour from the standards of classical economic rationality. For example, people often fail to count logically equivalent possibilities as equally desirable: an outcome described in terms of the probability of death will be evaluated differently from the same outcome described in terms of the probability of survival.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: medium;\">If we try to formulate laws of human psychology, we will inevitably have to ignore a great deal of the messy complexity of actual human life. This is sometimes legitimate, provided that we recognize the idealization and are prepared to restore the complexity when necessary\u2014when, for example, assuming the rationality of every free market would send us off an economic cliff.<\/span><\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":false,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">This is an easy question.<\/span> <br \/><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">The concluding paragraph of the essay begins with the text quoted in the question. The reason for ignoring the \"messy complexity of actual human life\" to create mathematical models of human behavior is explained in the concluding part of the essay. The writer says, \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">This is sometimes legitimate, provided that we recognize the idealization, and are prepared to restore the complexity when necessary.\u201d In simple words, the writer states that idealizing and reducing human behavior on instrumental grounds is a legitimate exercise only as long as we acknowledge that life is more complex than the mathematics that we have reduce it to, and are ready to give them up and embrace life whenever circumstances require us to do so.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">Option 1 best captures this and becomes our answer.\u00a0<\/span> <br \/><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">Option 2 is incorrect since the author does not say that human behavior is unpredictable.

Factors contributing to rising obesity levels, for example, include transportation systems and infrastructure, media, convenience foods, changing social norms, human biology and psychological factors. Designing an aircraft carrier, to take another example, requires knowledge of nuclear engineering, naval architecture, metallurgy, hydrodynamics, information systems, military protocols, the exercise of modern warfare and, given the long building time, the ability to predict trends in weapon systems.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">The multidimensional or layered character of complex problems undermines the principle of meritocracy: the idea that the \u2018best person\u2019 should be hired. There is no best person. When putting together an oncological research team, a biotech company would not construct a multiple-choice test and hire the top <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">scorers, or<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\"> hire people whose resume`s score highest according to some performance criteria. Instead, they would seek diversity. They would build a team of people who bring diverse knowledge bases, tools and analytic skills. That team would more likely than not include mathematicians. And the mathematicians would likely study dynamical systems and differential equations.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">Believers in a meritocracy might grant that teams ought to be diverse but then argue that meritocratic principles should apply within each category. <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">Thus<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\"> the team should consist of the \u2018best\u2019 mathematicians, the \u2018best\u2019 oncologists, and the \u2018best\u2019 biostatisticians from within the pool.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">That position suffers from a similar flaw. Even within a knowledge domain, no test or criteria applied to individuals will produce the best team. Each of these domains possesses such depth and breadth, that no test can exist. Consider the field of neuroscience. Upwards of 50,000 papers were published last year covering various techniques, domains of enquiry and levels of analysis, ranging from molecules and synapses up through networks of neurons. Given that complexity, any attempt to rank a collection of neuroscientists from best to worst, as if they were competitors in a race, must fail. What could be true is that given a specific task and the composition of a particular team, one scientist would be more likely to contribute than another. Optimal hiring depends on context. Optimal teams will be diverse. <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Evidence for this claim can be seen in the way that papers and patents that combine diverse ideas tend to rank as high-impact.<\/span> <br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">Yet the fallacy of meritocracy persists. Corporations, non-profits, governments, universities and even preschools test, score and hire the \u2018best\u2019. This all but guarantees not creating the best team. Ranking people by common criteria produces homogeneity. And when biases creep in, it results in people who look like those making the decisions. That\u2019s not likely to lead to breakthroughs. As Astro Teller, CEO of X, the \u2018moon shoot factory\u2019 at Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, has said: \u2018Having people who have different mental perspectives is what\u2019s important.

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/strong><\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Western civilization in the first half of the twentieth century was not very civilized. Human rights were trampled. Class war destroyed entire political systems. There were large-scale violent conflicts and much ethnic cleansing. Given this history, Westerners are in no position to lecture on civil liberties or humane values.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;\">It is also worth noting that the global march toward democracy, which seemed nearly inexorable after the fall of the Berlin Wall, now seems to be reversing. According to Stanford University\u2019s Larry Diamond, several countries that were democracies at the beginning of this century have since shifted to different systems.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;\">Of course, elections alone do not a democracy make. Consider those cases when elections empower a majority ethnic or religious group, which then rides roughshod over minorities \u2013 an outcome that has been seen all too often in the Balkans, for example.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;\">Then there are the cases when the election of a leader is treated as if it somehow legitimizes the subsequent emergence of dictatorship. This has been the case in Russia, which, since President Vladimir Putin\u2019s first electoral victory in 2000, has become a Potemkin democracy. <\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;\">In a real democracy, free and fair elections are complemented more broadly by the rule of law, due process, an independent judiciary, an active civil society, and freedom of the press, worship, assembly, and association. In fact, it is theoretically possible \u2013 though unlikely \u2013 for political systems to have all these elements without elections at all.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;\">Democracies depend on institutional software, not just hardware. The people who make them work accept a set of norms that often do not have to be codified. The problem comes when the people \u2013 or, worse, their leaders \u2013 refuse to adhere to democratic norms. That is what is happening today in the United States, as US President Donald Trump challenges some of the foundational rules, norms, and principles of American democracy. While some parts of America\u2019s democratic political system \u2013 for example, the judicial check on executive authority \u2013 have proved resilient, others are breaking down. But Trump is a consequence of this breakdown, not its cause.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Economic challenges, together with fears about migration, have created similar pressures in Europe, reflected in sizable support for right-wing populist parties in elections in Germany and France in the last year, as well as the rise of \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d in Hungary and Poland.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;\">Countering such assaults on democracy will require political leaders to show courage and vision \u2013 as French President Emmanuel Macron has so far \u2013 in defending the values that underpin democratic governance. In the European Union, this means that leaders must not turn a blind eye to elected governments\u2019 assault on the institutions that safeguard freedom. After all, the EU not just a customs union; it is a union of shared values. If it fails to act accordingly, it will crumble. In the 1930s, some admired Adolf Hitler\u2019s autobahns and Benito Mussolini\u2019s success in getting the trains to run on time. But it was clearly not worth the cost. The same is true of China today. Yes, the country has become an economic powerhouse in recent decades. But if a system cannot survive basic dissent \u2013 from legal challenges to television parodies \u2013 can it really be as strong as its leaders claim? And if a crackdown on corruption is carried out by a corrupt dictatorship, can it really be considered legitimate?<\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Contrast this with India, which may have lost the economic race in the last few years, but has held together since independence, despite vast ethnic, religious, and linguistic differences \u2013 <\/span>without needing to create a Bamboo Gulag. This does not mean that there is no dissent or disagreement. But, no matter how much Indians argue, they are not locking up or \u201cdisappearing\u201d dissidents, thanks to the safety valves afforded by their democracy. No society can manage indefinitely without such mechanisms. Even Karl Marx, I think, would not have disagreed.<\/span><\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":false,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;\">This question is of medium difficulty. <\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">The passage states that several countries have shifted from democracy to other systems in the recent past.

The writer refers to Hitler\u2019s\u2019 autobahn and Benito Mussolini\u2019s success in getting the trains to run on time, and remarks that it was clearly not the worth the cost; costs in terms of security and liberty.

However, Potemkin means: having a false or deceptive appearance, especially one presented for the purpose of propaganda. Historically the term Potemkin originated in the 1930s, from Grigori Aleksandrovich Potyomkin, a favourite of Empress Catherine II of Russia, who reputedly gave the order for sham villages to be built for the empress's tour of the Crimea in 1787.

They are all mysterious, for one thing\u2014eye-catchingly weird, yet still just hazy outlines that let the imagination run wild. All have recently generated headlines as possible signs of life and intelligence beyond Earth, of some mind-bogglingly advanced alien culture revealing its existence at last to our relatively primitive and planet-bound civilization. Yet their most salient shared trait so far is the certainty they provoke in most scientists, who insist these developments represent nothing so sensational. Ask a savvy astronomer or physicist about any of these oddities, and they will tell you, as they have time and time before: It\u2019s not aliens. In fact, it\u2019s never aliens.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">Far from being close-minded killjoys, most scientists in the \u201cnever aliens\u201d camp desperately want to be convinced otherwise.

What is really extraordinary, the <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">skeptics<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\"> say, is not so much the possibility of <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">extraterrestrial<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\"> intelligence but rather the notion that its existence nearby or visitation of Earth could be something easily unnoticed or overlooked.

These technologies allow genetic material to be added, removed, <\/span>or altered at particular locations in the genome. Several approaches to genome editing have been developed. A recent one is known as CRISPR-Cas9, which is short for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated protein 9.

The bacteria capture snippets of DNA from invading viruses and use them to create DNA segments known as CRISPR arrays. The CRISPR arrays allow the bacteria to \"remember\" the viruses (or closely related ones).

As in bacteria, the modified RNA is used to recognize the DNA sequence, and the Cas9 enzyme cuts the DNA at the targeted location. Although Cas9 is the enzyme that is used most often, other enzymes (for example Cpf1) can also be used. Once the DNA is cut, researchers use the cell's own DNA repair machinery to add or delete pieces of genetic material, or to make changes to the DNA by replacing an existing segment with a customized DNA sequence.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Genome editing is of great interest in the prevention and treatment of human diseases.

These technologies allow genetic material to be added, removed, <\/span>or altered at particular locations in the genome. Several approaches to genome editing have been developed. A recent one is known as CRISPR-Cas9, which is short for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated protein 9. The CRISPR-Cas9 system has generated a lot of excitement in the scientific community because it is faster, cheaper, more accurate, and more efficient than other existing genome editing methods.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: medium;\">CRISPR-Cas9 was adapted from a naturally occurring genome editing system in bacteria. The bacteria capture snippets of DNA from invading viruses and use them to create DNA segments known as CRISPR arrays. The CRISPR arrays allow the bacteria to \"remember\" the viruses (or closely related ones). If the viruses attack again, the bacteria produce RNA segments from the CRISPR arrays to target the viruses' DNA. The bacteria then use Cas9 or a similar enzyme to cut the DNA apart, which disables the virus.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: medium;\">The CRISPR-Cas9 system works similarly in the lab. Researchers create a small piece of RNA with a short \"guide\" sequence that attaches (binds) to a specific target sequence of DNA in a genome. The RNA also binds to the Cas9 enzyme. As in bacteria, the modified RNA is used to recognize the DNA sequence, and the Cas9 enzyme cuts the DNA at the targeted location. Although Cas9 is the enzyme that is used most often, other enzymes (for example Cpf1) can also be used. Once the DNA is cut, researchers use the cell's own DNA repair machinery to add or delete pieces of genetic material, or to make changes to the DNA by replacing an existing segment with a customized DNA sequence.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Genome editing is of great interest in the prevention and treatment of human diseases.

So, let us look at two contrasting options available in the answer choices. The first part is about Nietzsche\u2019s point of view about philosophy must be historical \u2013 it could be his skepticism, or his conviction that philosophy is historical. So his skepticism or conviction is contrasted with his simultaneous belief that writing about philosophy historically is unproductive or problematic \u2013 is he was skeptic, and unproductive do not provide the contrast \u2013 so the conjunction despite is a misfit. We can eliminate option 1. At eh same time we can also see that option 2 provides the contrast we are looking for and is correct. So we need to consider options that are contrasting in them, similar to conviction and problematic. Nihilism and absurdism are tow doctrines. Nihilism is a doctrine or a viewpoint that traditional values and beliefs are unfounded and that existence is senseless and useless. Absurdism, similarly, is a philosophy based on the belief that the universe is irrational and meaningless and that the search for order brings the individual into conflict with the universe. Hence, both the words are narrow in scope and technical, with narrow and specific meanings - cannot describe an effort to write historically about philosophy.

Whether the sequence is 325 or 352 needs some deliberation. 3-2-5- is a better sequence than 3-5-2 because 32 explains why the ordinary event (which we later learn that of people sitting on parapets) stopped him in his tracks \u2013 the reason was that the company of his friend put that incident in completely different context \u2013 that context is then explained in sentence 5.

Only sentence 4 fits the bill as all the other sentences have references that derive their meaning from elsewhere. \u2018This highly uneven dispersion\u2019 in sentence 1, \u2018those populations\u2019 is sentence 2, make them unfit for the starter. Sentence 3 is too short and abrupt. Sentence 5 says \u201cnew research shows they are highly concentrated \u2026\u201d \u2013 the pronoun \u2018they\u2019 needs an antecedent.\u00a0<\/span> <br \/><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">So we are sure that the paragraph starts with sentence 4.

However, 5-1 cannot be placed immediately after 4, because 4 and 5-1 have contrary ideas. Sentence 4 says that mammals span much of the world. 5-1 pair talks about uneven dispersion. Hence they are contrary. Sentence 3 says \u2018Reptiles do not\u2019. This can bridge the gap between sentence 4 and the 5-1- pair. That mammals span the world \u2013 reptiles do not. So, \u201cthey\u201d in sentence 5 refers to the reptiles in sentence 4.
