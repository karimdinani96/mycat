After our hominid relative Homo erectus fanned out from Africa into Eurasia starting some two million years ago, Homo sapiens followed around 60,000 to 80,000 years ago and became widespread in Eurasia, joining our close cousins, the Neandertals and Denisovans. It is thought Homo sapiens later reached Australia between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago and finally settled the Americas between 13,000 and 15,000 years ago. In the time line of mammalian extinctions, large animals started to disappear only after humans or their hominid cousins showed up. But could that be a coincidence? Others have argued the main culprit behind these die-offs was the changing climate.<\/span><\/span><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In North America the average mammal weighed around 98 kilograms before the ancestors of humans showed up.

A suite of animals that evolved in Eurasia, Australia and the Americas without the risk of predation from tool-using, fire-making, group-living hominids were suddenly faced <\/span>with a new threat. They simply could not adapt fast enough to survive the incursion of these omnivorous bipedal apes.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In addition, Smith<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u2019<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">s analysis looked at the size distribution of African mammals prior to the hominid migration into Eurasia.

What that means, she says, is <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">these groups of hominid species were having impacts on a continental scale before the evolution of modern humans.<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201d <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">And it does not take all that many hominids to have such broad effects. Driving a large species to extinction does not mean killing every last one of its members. <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">You just have to kill slightly more than are being produced each year,<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201d <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Lindsey says.

Mammoths and mastodons, for example, likely had a two-year gestation period, akin to modern elephants, and would have typically produced just one offspring at a time. It is therefore a lot easier to decimate a population of 100,000 mammoths than a population of 100,000 rabbits, which reproduce twice a year and birth by litter.<\/span><\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":false,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">This is a medium difficulty question.<\/span> <br \/><br \/> <span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">The passage starts by claiming that<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">On every continent mammals on average were a lot larger in the late Pleistocene\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">\u2026\u201d\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">The second paragraph ties the cause of extinction of these large mammals to human evolution by stating that\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">large mammals started to die out around the same time as humans first showed up.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">\u201d\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">The next paragraph states that if this extinction trend continues, then modern large mammals will also disappear, and the domestic cow may be the largest mammal alive 200 years from now. The author then explores in detail the link between human activities and the extinction of large species. Later, the passage states that\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">Large-bodied mammals are especially vulnerable [to extinction] because they reproduce slowly.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">\u201d\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">Thus, the main idea of the passage is that among other reasons human activities accelerate the extinction of large mammals even today.\u00a0<\/span> <br \/><br \/> <span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">Option 1 is incorrect. The passage does not suggest whether we must start thinking about minimizing our impact on Earth. Eliminate option 1.<\/span> <br \/><br \/> <span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">Option 2 is incorrect. This option is an exaggeration, we cannot conclude from the passage whether humans or their ancestors deliberately killed huge number of large mammals. Eliminate option 2.<\/span> <br \/><br \/> <span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">Option 4 is incorrect. This option correctly covers one of the themes of the passage that human activities led to the extinction of large mammals in the late Pleistocene. But it fails to mention the other major point of the passage that human activities are driving modern large mammals to extinct as well. Eliminate option 4.<\/span> <br \/><br \/> <span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">Option 3 is correct.

Also, even if they are killed for meat we have no data from the passage to conclude if they are being killed more than are being produced each year. So, option 4 is not advanced as an extinction risk to modern mammals.

The passage makes no reference to ability of hominids to adapt fast and get a survival advantage. Eliminate option 3. <\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;\"> Option 4 is incorrect. This option is irrelevant to the question. Even though hominids impacted the size distribution of mammals, it is not the reason why large mammals could not survive the incursion of hominids. Eliminate option 4. <\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Option 2 is correct. Paragraph 6 states,\u00a0<span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">They (the large mammals) simply could not adapt fast enough to survive the incursion of these omnivorous bipedal apes.<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201d\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Also, the 7<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><sup>th<\/sup><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> paragraph explains further that\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">If a population's reproduction rate cannot compensate for its losses each year, within a few hundred to a couple thousand years the species will simply die out.<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201d\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Thus, we can conclude that hominids caused the death of more individuals of large mammals than those mammals could reproduce.

Writing her imaginary story of a being jolted to life by Victor Frankenstein, Mary drew on the cutting-edge science of her time, including galvanism and electricity.

In physics, it is what is known as the Alcubierre Warp Drive.

One of these restrictions is the belief that the speed of light is unbreakable and hence, that there will never be such a thing as FTL space travel or exploration. But then, in 1994, a Mexican physicist by the name of Miguel Alcubierre came along with proposed method for stretching the fabric of space-time in way which would, in theory, allow FTL travel to take pace.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">To put it simply, this method of space travel involves stretching the fabric of space-time in a wave which would (in theory) cause the space ahead of an object to contract while the space behind it would expand. An object inside this wave (i.e. a spaceship) would then be able to ride this region, known as a <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">warp bubble<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201d <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">of flat space. This is what is known as the <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Alcubierre Metric<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201d<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">. Interpreted in the context of General Relativity, the metric allows a warp bubble to appear in a previously flat region of spacetime and move away, effectively at speeds that exceed the speed of light. The interior of the bubble is the inertial reference frame for any object inhabiting it.<\/span><\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The mathematical formulation of the Alcubierre metric is consistent with the conventional claims of the laws of relativity and conventional<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">relativistic<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">effects. Since the ship is not moving within this <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">bubble, but<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> is being carried along as the region itself moves, the laws of relativity would not be violated in the conventional sense.<\/span><\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">One of the reasons for this is because this method would not rely on moving faster than light in the local sense, since a light beam within this bubble would still always move faster than the ship. It is only <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">faster than light<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201d <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">in the sense that the ship could reach its destination faster than a beam of light that was traveling outside the warp bubble.<\/span><\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;\">However, there are few problems with this theory. For one, there are no known methods to create such a warp bubble in a region of space that would not already contain one.

In physics, it is what is known as the Alcubierre Warp Drive. On paper, it is a highly speculative, but possibly valid solution of the Einstein field equations, specifically how space, time and energy interact.<\/span><\/span><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;\">Since Einstein first proposed the Special Theory of Relativity in 1905, scientists have been operating under the restrictions imposed by a relativistic universe. One of these restrictions is the belief that the speed of light is unbreakable and hence, that there will never be such a thing as FTL space travel or exploration. But then, in 1994, a Mexican physicist by the name of Miguel Alcubierre came along with proposed method for stretching the fabric of space-time in way which would, in theory, allow FTL travel to take pace.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">To put it simply, this method of space travel involves stretching the fabric of space-time in a wave which would (in theory) cause the space ahead of an object to contract while the space behind it would expand. An object inside this wave (i.e. a spaceship) would then be able to ride this region, known as a <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">warp bubble<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201d <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">of flat space. This is what is known as the <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Alcubierre Metric<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201d<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">. Interpreted in the context of General Relativity, the metric allows a warp bubble to appear in a previously flat region of spacetime and move away, effectively at speeds that exceed the speed of light. The interior of the bubble is the inertial reference frame for any object inhabiting it.<\/span><\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The mathematical formulation of the Alcubierre metric is consistent with the conventional claims of the laws of relativity and conventional<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">relativistic<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">effects. Since the ship is not moving within this <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">bubble, but<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> is being carried along as the region itself moves, the laws of relativity would not be violated in the conventional sense.<\/span><\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">One of the reasons for this is because this method would not rely on moving faster than light in the local sense, since a light beam within this bubble would still always move faster than the ship. It is only <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">faster than light<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201d <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">in the sense that the ship could reach its destination faster than a beam of light that was traveling outside the warp bubble.<\/span><\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;\">However, there are few problems with this theory. For one, there are no known methods to create such a warp bubble in a region of space that would not already contain one. Second, assuming there was a way to create such a bubble, there is not yet any known way of leaving once inside it.

One of these restrictions is the belief that the speed of light is unbreakable and hence, that there will never be such a thing as FTL space travel or exploration. But then, in 1994, a Mexican physicist by the name of Miguel Alcubierre came along with proposed method for stretching the fabric of space-time in way which would, in theory, allow FTL travel to take pace.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">To put it simply, this method of space travel involves stretching the fabric of space-time in a wave which would (in theory) cause the space ahead of an object to contract while the space behind it would expand. An object inside this wave (i.e. a spaceship) would then be able to ride this region, known as a <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">warp bubble<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201d <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">of flat space.

Interpreted in the context of General Relativity, the metric allows a warp bubble to appear in a previously flat region of spacetime and move away, effectively at speeds that exceed the speed of light. The interior of the bubble is the inertial reference frame for any object inhabiting it.<\/span><\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The mathematical formulation of the Alcubierre metric is consistent with the conventional claims of the laws of relativity and conventional<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">relativistic<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">effects. Since the ship is not moving within this <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">bubble, but<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> is being carried along as the region itself moves, the laws of relativity would not be violated in the conventional sense.<\/span><\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">One of the reasons for this is because this method would not rely on moving faster than light in the local sense, since a light beam within this bubble would still always move faster than the ship. It is only <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">faster than light<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201d <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">in the sense that the ship could reach its destination faster than a beam of light that was traveling outside the warp bubble.<\/span><\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;\">However, there are few problems with this theory. For one, there are no known methods to create such a warp bubble in a region of space that would not already contain one. Second, assuming there was a way to create such a bubble, there is not yet any known way of leaving once inside it.

In physics, it is what is known as the Alcubierre Warp Drive. On paper, it is a highly speculative, but possibly valid solution of the Einstein field equations, specifically how space, time and energy interact.<\/span><\/span><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;\">Since Einstein first proposed the Special Theory of Relativity in 1905, scientists have been operating under the restrictions imposed by a relativistic universe. One of these restrictions is the belief that the speed of light is unbreakable and hence, that there will never be such a thing as FTL space travel or exploration. But then, in 1994, a Mexican physicist by the name of Miguel Alcubierre came along with proposed method for stretching the fabric of space-time in way which would, in theory, allow FTL travel to take pace.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">To put it simply, this method of space travel involves stretching the fabric of space-time in a wave which would (in theory) cause the space ahead of an object to contract while the space behind it would expand. An object inside this wave (i.e. a spaceship) would then be able to ride this region, known as a <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">warp bubble<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201d <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">of flat space. This is what is known as the <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Alcubierre Metric<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201d<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">. Interpreted in the context of General Relativity, the metric allows a warp bubble to appear in a previously flat region of spacetime and move away, effectively at speeds that exceed the speed of light. The interior of the bubble is the inertial reference frame for any object inhabiting it.<\/span><\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The mathematical formulation of the Alcubierre metric is consistent with the conventional claims of the laws of relativity and conventional<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">relativistic<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">effects. Since the ship is not moving within this <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">bubble, but<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> is being carried along as the region itself moves, the laws of relativity would not be violated in the conventional sense.<\/span><\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">One of the reasons for this is because this method would not rely on moving faster than light in the local sense, since a light beam within this bubble would still always move faster than the ship. It is only <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">faster than light<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201d <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">in the sense that the ship could reach its destination faster than a beam of light that was traveling outside the warp bubble.<\/span><\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;\">However, there are few problems with this theory. For one, there are no known methods to create such a warp bubble in a region of space that would not already contain one. Second, assuming there was a way to create such a bubble, there is not yet any known way of leaving once inside it. As a result, the Alcubierre drive (or metric) remains in the category of theory at this time.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In 2012, NASA<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u2019<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">s Advanced Propulsion Physics Laboratory (<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">aka.Eagleworks<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">) announced that they had begun conducting experiments to see if a <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">warp drive<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201d <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">was in fact possible.

In physics, it is what is known as the Alcubierre Warp Drive. On paper, it is a highly speculative, but possibly valid solution of the Einstein field equations, specifically how space, time and energy interact.<\/span><\/span><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;\">Since Einstein first proposed the Special Theory of Relativity in 1905, scientists have been operating under the restrictions imposed by a relativistic universe. One of these restrictions is the belief that the speed of light is unbreakable and hence, that there will never be such a thing as FTL space travel or exploration. But then, in 1994, a Mexican physicist by the name of Miguel Alcubierre came along with proposed method for stretching the fabric of space-time in way which would, in theory, allow FTL travel to take pace.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">To put it simply, this method of space travel involves stretching the fabric of space-time in a wave which would (in theory) cause the space ahead of an object to contract while the space behind it would expand. An object inside this wave (i.e. a spaceship) would then be able to ride this region, known as a <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">warp bubble<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201d <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">of flat space. This is what is known as the <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Alcubierre Metric<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201d<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">. Interpreted in the context of General Relativity, the metric allows a warp bubble to appear in a previously flat region of spacetime and move away, effectively at speeds that exceed the speed of light. The interior of the bubble is the inertial reference frame for any object inhabiting it.<\/span><\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The mathematical formulation of the Alcubierre metric is consistent with the conventional claims of the laws of relativity and conventional<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">relativistic<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">effects. Since the ship is not moving within this <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">bubble, but<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> is being carried along as the region itself moves, the laws of relativity would not be violated in the conventional sense.<\/span><\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">One of the reasons for this is because this method would not rely on moving faster than light in the local sense, since a light beam within this bubble would still always move faster than the ship. It is only <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">faster than light<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201d <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">in the sense that the ship could reach its destination faster than a beam of light that was traveling outside the warp bubble.<\/span><\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;\">However, there are few problems with this theory. For one, there are no known methods to create such a warp bubble in a region of space that would not already contain one. Second, assuming there was a way to create such a bubble, there is not yet any known way of leaving once inside it. As a result, the Alcubierre drive (or metric) remains in the category of theory at this time.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In 2012, NASA<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u2019<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">s Advanced Propulsion Physics Laboratory (<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">aka.Eagleworks<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">) announced that they had begun conducting experiments to see if a <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">warp drive<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201d <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">was in fact possible.

First Rawls concern is to define\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">justice as fairness<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">\u201d\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">and not the familiar concept of justice which everyone knows.

Second, Rawls also defines injustice\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">\u2013\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">which is an unequal distribution of social values which is not to the benefit of all. Option 1 does not mention injustice. We can eliminate option 1.\u00a0<\/span> <br \/><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">Option 2 is incorrect. A major point in the paragraph, and vital to Rawls<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">\u2019<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">s notion of\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">\u2018<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">justice as fairness<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">\u2019\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">is the idea that personal attributes are morally arbitrary or unreasonable. This is not included in option 2 . Eliminate option 2.\u00a0<\/span> <br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Option 3 is incorrect. It has the deficiencies of both option 1 and option 2 in not capturing the points about personal attributes being inconsequential and the conception of justice as\u00a0<span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u2018<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">justice as fairness<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u2019\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">by Rawls.

So, sentences 1 and 3 are a mandatory pair.\u00a0<\/span> <br \/> <br \/><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">We can also notice that sentences 2 and 5 are another mandatory pair. Sentence 5 says that privacy barely existed in those times. The reason is explained in sentence 2: Everyone would sleep cheek by jowl; servants, apprentices and, the extended family. So 2- 5 have to be together in that order.\u00a0<\/span> <br \/> <br \/><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000;\">These mandatory pairs are best placed in the order 1325.

The verb engage is a transitive verb and needs an object \u2013 so we engage someone in something, except when it is used in the sense of hiring e.g., engaged a lawyer. In the current context, the intended meaning is to keep their existing customers engaged (in something). The second sentence is incorrect - \u2018grow sites traffic\u2019 and \u2018grow customer engagement\u2019 are non-idiomatic and awkward. The intended meaning is \u201cincrease the site\u2019s traffic\u201d and \u201cimprove customer engagement.\u201d Or better - \u201cimprove customer experience.\u201d Sentence 2 has unnecessary verbs.
