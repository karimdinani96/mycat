By drawing readers in large numbers, contemporary fantasy\r\n  becomes a platform to debate key current social and political challenges,\r\n  while science fiction continues to explore the impact of technological\r\n  developments, for good and ill, before we have to tackle these things in\r\n  reality.<o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p class=body><span lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'><o:p>&nbsp;<\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n  <p class=body><span lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'>Speculative fiction\r\n  has been the mainstay of children's literature for many decades, and has now\r\n  become a dominant force in popular culture, from <i>Battlestar Galactica<\/i>\r\n  and <i>Game of Thrones<\/i> on TV to the <i>Hunger Games<\/i> films and the new\r\n  <i>Captain America<\/i>.
