Archaeological records provide ample evidence of fires occurring spontaneously \u2013 as a result of volcanic action, sunlight, lightning, build-ups of gases \u2013 from millions of years ago onwards. So our ancestors would have had plenty of opportunities to observe fires, develop strategies for coping with them and even benefit from them.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\">It is not clear when humans began to use fire. Some debated findings suggest that the australopithecines, distant ancestors of Homo sapiens, could have been using fire at <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Makapansgat<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">, in South Africa, 1.5 million years ago, while others put the figure at only 500,000 years ago, which would make fire a new tool in the repertoire of Homo erectus. A novel find in 2004 suggests that Homo erectus may well have used fire some 790,000 years ago. Experts think that the control of fire encouraged social interaction, enabled dramatic changes in the diet of proto-humans and gave them the ability to defend themselves against wild animals.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Fire would certainly have offered early humans huge advantages with respect to survival and reproduction; so there would have been a strong incentive to learn how to create as well as control it. <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Sterkfontein<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">, a South African cave, provides a classic illustration of how fire helped the balance of power to shift towards intelligent humans, and away from brawny beasts. Early layers of the cave reveal humans to be the prey of big cats; in later ones, contemporaneous with evidence of human-made fire, the predators are being consumed by us.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\">By burning scrubland, fires enabled human hunters to see their prey more clearly. Cooked food was easier to chew and digest, and could also be preserved for longer, leaving more time for activities not related to hunting or gathering. Fire may also have become a useful element in the hunt itself. Evidence in Spain suggests humans might have used fires to drive herds of large mammals \u2013 including elephants \u2013 off a precipice; a lazy way of butchering in volume.<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Fire lent us a massive advantage. The burning of scrubland also encouraged the growth of edible grasses and legumes \u2013 exactly the plants that humans would later come to domesticate. In addition to being edible by us, these first crops would have attracted hosts of small game to the site, which could then be picked off at will.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\">It is impossible to imagine farming without fire. For a start, the cereal crops first domesticated were only truly edible as a result of fire \u2013 either boiled into a pottage or baked into <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">a crude<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> bread. Fire would have attracted small pack animals to the fringes of human settlements, where humans would have captured them and domesticated them. Most importantly of all, it cleared the land and replenished its resources. <\/span><\/p><p><br \/>In numerous tribal groups, land is still claimed by means of setting light to it: man establishes his perceived dominion over nature with fire, as he almost certainly did 10,000\u201312,000 years ago, when global warming coincided with a population bulge. At this point the need for new territory might well have necessitated mass torching of the land. As areas became settled, the occupants re-enacted the original \u2018claiming\u2019 fire every two years or so, aware that the ashes would revivify and enrich the soil. This classic \u2018slash and burn\u2019 technique continues in some parts of the world to this day.<\/p>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":false,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"Explanation":"<p><span>This<\/span><span> is an easy EXCEPT question.<\/span> <br \/> <br \/><span>Option 1 is incorrect because it is not an exception.

For many, indeed, it doesn\u2019t merely hold up: it is the archetype for what a scientific theory should look like.

Sentence 3 has reference to \u201cthe first group\u201d and Sentence 4 refers to \u201cthe second group\u201d making them dependent on other sentences in which the groups are specified.&nbsp;\r<br \/>Between statements 1, 2 and 5, statement 5 introduces the concept of minority \u201canywhere\u201d against a majority \u201csomewhere\u201d in Western societies.  Statement 5 also introduces the author of this concept as David&nbsp;Goodhart. Thus, Statement 5 is clearly the&nbsp;the starter sentence.&nbsp;\r<br \/>\u201cThe first group\u201d in statement is the minority group of \u201canywhere\u201d in statement 5. Thus, 5-3 is a mandatory pair. Statement 2 talks about valuing geographical and social mobility. It can be either about the first group or the second group. If it talks about the first group then we\u2019ll get 3-2 as the mandatory pair. But, if it refers to the second group then we\u2019ll get 4-2 as the mandatory pair. Statement 4 states that the second group is&nbsp;characterised by identities rooted in a place.&nbsp;\r<br \/>From this we can conclude that since the second group prefers identities rooted in a place, it would not value geographical mobility. Hence sentence 2 follows the 5-3 pair. So we get the sequence 5-3-2.\r<br \/>Statement 4 follows since it now gives details about the second group i.e. the majority \u201csomewhere\u201d mentioned in statement 5. Thus we have the sequence 5324.&nbsp;\r<br \/>Statement 1 now explains the contrast and the struggle between the&nbsp;Anywheres and the&nbsp;Somewheres groups and states the conclusion that&nbsp;Anywheres have largely benefited from the global economy while&nbsp;Somehwheres have been left behind.&nbsp;\r<br \/>Thus, the correct sequence is 53241.@@@~SimCAT-11-2018-VA-RC-Q.31","VideoExplanation":null,"DocxSolutionUrl":null,"SolutionUploadedType":null,"PlayerMode":"VIMEO","VimeoLink":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/366428630","VimeoURI":"\/videos\/366428630","YoutubeURL":null,"ItemBankID":0,"Difficulty":"Medium","DifficultyLevel":7,"ItemBank":0,"QuestionPaper":0,"IsProofRead":null,"CorrectIndex":0,"QuestionPaperSectionID":8600,"IsRequiredQuestion":null,"TestID":0,"IsQuestionPackTimer":null,"SelectedOption":null,"IsCorrected":null,"EnteredResponse":null,"IsMarked":null,"OriginalTestID":null,"TimePerQuestion":0,"IsAttempt":null,"timetaken":null,"StudentMCAResponse":null,"ItemOptionResponse":[{"ItemOptionID":666803,"ItemID":157392,"Options":"53241","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":true,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":666804,"ItemID":157392,"Options":"x","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":666805,"ItemID":157392,"Options":"y","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":666806,"ItemID":157392,"Options":"z","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":0,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0}],"qindex":30,"qsectionindex":0,"qindexbysection":30},{"IsPassageQuestionSplit":true,"MaxWords":0,"ItemID":157393,"ItemType":"NE","SubjectName":"Verbal Ability","SubjectID":203,"AreaName":"Verbal Reasoning","AreaID":500,"TopicName":"Sentence out of context","TopicID":4988,"ItemOptions":null,"SubTopicID":0,"StarRating":null,"ItemBankName":null,"Direction":"","Title":"Q.32","IsApproved":null,"Items":"<span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"><\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"><b>Four out of five sentences in the options, when correctly sequenced, form a coherent paragraph.

So we can see that 5-2 is a mandatory pair. A mandatory pair is always very useful to identify the specific theme of the paragraph.
